### [1] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在关系抽取任务中表现出保守偏差，倾向于选择无关系标签，导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏差比幻觉更常见，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在关系抽取中的保守偏差行为及其对信息提取的影响。

Method: 使用多种提示、数据集和关系类型系统评估保守偏差，引入Hobson's choice概念，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化语义相似性。

Result: 保守偏差的发生频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守行为在约束提示下与半约束和开放式提示生成的标签有语义相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs的保守偏差虽避免错误关系分配，但导致信息丢失，需进一步优化模型行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

### [2] [QA-LIGN: Aligning LLMs through Constitutionally Decomposed QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08123)
*Jacob Dineen,Aswin RRV,Qin Liu,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ming Shen,Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Chitta Baral,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过分解奖励机制中的原则，提升语言模型对齐的透明度和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准奖励对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标不透明且难以解释。

Method: QA-LIGN为每个原则设计特定评估问题，生成独立奖励组件，替代传统黑盒奖励模型。

Result: 实验显示QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于基线，性能与DPO相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的方法，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

### [3] [EconWebArena: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Economic Tasks in Realistic Web Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08136)
*Zefang Liu,Yinzhu Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconWebArena是一个用于评估自主代理在复杂、多模态经济任务中的表现的基准测试，包含360个任务，覆盖多个经济领域，强调权威数据源和基于网络的经济推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对权威数据源和多模态经济任务的关注，EconWebArena填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过大型语言模型生成候选任务，经人工筛选确保清晰性、可行性和数据可靠性，评估多模态LLM在任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现多模态LLM在数据基础、导航和多模态理解方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

### [4] [Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Using Translation-Based Approaches with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08147)
*Muhammad Usman,Muhammad Ahmad,M. Shahiki Tash,Irina Gelbukh,Rolando Quintero Tellez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力层和大型语言模型的多语言仇恨言论检测方法，针对英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，但乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究较少，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 使用注意力层增强特征提取，结合GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B等模型，同时采用TF-IDF提取特征。

Result: 在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语上分别达到0.87、0.85和0.81的宏F1分数，多语言模型达到0.88。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

### [5] [ETT-CKGE: Efficient Task-driven Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08158)
*Lijing Zhu,Qizhen Lan,Qing Tian,Wenbo Sun,Li Yang,Lu Xia,Yixin Xie,Xi Xiao,Tiehang Duan,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图谱嵌入方法，通过可学习的任务相关令牌取代传统节点评分和图遍历，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在知识保留和计算效率上存在不足，无法有效处理大规模知识图谱的持续更新。

Method: ETT-CKGE引入可学习的任务驱动令牌，通过简单的矩阵操作实现知识迁移，避免了显式节点评分和图遍历。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，ETT-CKGE表现出优越或竞争性的预测性能，同时显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE为持续知识图谱嵌入提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于大规模知识图谱的动态更新。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

### [6] [Can Artificial Intelligence Write Like Borges? An Evaluation Protocol for Spanish Microfiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08172)
*Gerardo Aleman Manzanarez,Nora de la Cruz Arana,Jorge Garcia Flores,Yobany Garcia Medina,Raul Monroy,Nathalie Pernelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文学理论的评估协议GrAImes，用于客观评估AI生成的微型小说的文学价值，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI能生成叙事一致且语言连贯的短篇小说，但对其文学价值的严格评估（尤其是美学品质）缺乏关注。

Method: 提出GrAImes协议，基于文学理论，从主题连贯性、文本清晰度、解释深度和美学品质等多方面评估AI生成的微型小说。

Result: 验证了GrAImes协议的有效性，得到了文学专家和文学爱好者的认可。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为评估AI生成的微型小说的文学价值提供了客观框架。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

### [7] [LLM-BT: Back-Translation as a Framework for Terminology Standardization and Dynamic Semantic Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08174)
*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-BT是一个基于大型语言模型的回译框架，用于自动化术语验证和标准化，通过跨语言语义对齐实现高一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家驱动的标准化方法在快速发展的领域（如AI和量子计算）中难以应对多语言一致性挑战。

Method: 提出LLM-BT框架，结合术语级一致性验证、多路径验证工作流和回译作为语义嵌入的方法。

Result: 实验显示术语一致性超过90%，跨语言鲁棒性强（BLEU>0.45，葡萄牙语准确率100%）。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将回译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，适用于全球科技领域的术语治理。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

### [8] [Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184)
*Chupei Wang,Jiaqiu Vince Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中信息检索与生成能力的关联，发现上下文干扰显著影响检索准确性，提示模型存在工作记忆瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在信息检索中因上下文干扰导致的性能下降，借鉴认知科学中的主动干扰（PI）范式。

Method: 提出PI-LLM评估方法，通过顺序流式传输语义相关的键值更新并仅查询最终值，测试LLMs的检索能力。

Result: LLMs的检索准确性随干扰累积呈对数线性下降至零，提示工程缓解效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在干扰分离和信息灵活处理方面存在根本限制，需改进模型抑制无关内容的能力。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

### [9] ["I Wrote, I Paused, I Rewrote" Teaching LLMs to Read Between the Lines of Student Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08221)
*Samra Zafar,Shaheer Minhas,Syed Ali Hassan Zaidi,Arfa Naeem,Zahra Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用写作过程数据（如键盘记录和定期快照）改进大型语言模型（LLM）对学生写作反馈的效果，发现学生更倾向于基于过程的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏写作过程的上下文，无法反映学生的思考和修改过程。

Method: 开发了一个数字写作工具，记录学生的打字内容和文章演变过程，并让20名学生使用该工具完成限时写作，随后通过LLM生成反馈并收集学生评价。

Result: 学生更偏好基于过程的LLM反馈，认为其更贴近自身思维；某些编辑行为（如添加内容或重组段落）与更高的连贯性和详述得分相关。

Conclusion: 增强LLM对写作过程的感知能力，可提供更有意义、个性化和支持性的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

TL;DR: 本文综述了复合AI系统优化的最新进展，包括数值和基于语言的技术，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复合AI系统复杂度的增加，优化组件及其交互成为新挑战，需要探索传统方法之外的新途径。

Result: 总结了数值和语言反馈技术在优化中的应用，并指出了开放研究挑战。

Conclusion: 复合AI系统优化是一个快速发展的领域，未来需要进一步探索语言反馈等新方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/AISysOpt-Survey.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Yupeng Cao,Haohang Li,Yangyang Yu,Nikhil Muralidhar,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在科学论文中提取和验证声明与证据能力的基准测试，揭示了LLMs在处理复杂科学内容时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs是否能够真正理解和处理复杂研究论文中的逻辑关系，特别是声明与支持证据之间的联系。

Method: 研究采用了三种基于分治策略的方法，并在六种不同的LLMs上进行了系统比较，评估了300多个声明-证据对。

Result: 结果显示，闭源模型（如GPT-4和Claude）在声明-证据识别任务中的表现优于开源模型，且三遍和逐一提示方法显著提高了LLMs的准确性，但增加了计算成本。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设定了新标准，并为构建更可靠的推理系统提供了诊断工具和路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

### [12] [Automatic Generation of Inference Making Questions for Reading Comprehension Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08260)
*Wanjing Anya Ma,Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了阅读理解中的推理能力，提出了一种推理类型分类法，并利用GPT-4o生成诊断性阅读理解题目，验证了自动生成与人工判断结合的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升阅读理解教学中诊断性问题的有效性，为学龄学生提供更有针对性的阅读指导和干预。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，分析诊断性阅读理解题库中的题目分布；使用GPT-4o通过少量示例生成推理题目，比较有无思维链提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成的题目93.8%质量良好，适合3-12年级使用，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型。

Conclusion: 自动生成与人工判断结合是扩展高质量诊断性阅读理解评估的有前景的方法。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the
OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata
(bibliographic, source, and generated) of the 983,004 volumes, or 242B tokens,
identified as being in the public domain have been made available. This report
describes this project's goals and methods as well as the results of the
analyses we performed, all in service of making this historical collection more
accessible and easier for humans and machines alike to filter, read and use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常产生冗余输出，影响效率。研究探讨显式自我反思是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，在推理过程中抑制显式自我反思标记。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait为多模态推理提供了一种高效且性能保持的即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Bloom分类法的多认知层次评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在医学领域的表现，发现模型在认知复杂度增加时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在不同认知层次上的医学能力表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出多认知层次评估框架，整合现有医学数据集，设计针对三个认知层次的任务，并评估六种主流大语言模型。

Result: 模型在认知复杂度增加时性能显著下降，模型规模对高认知层次任务表现影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究强调需提升大语言模型在高认知层次的医学能力，为开发适合实际医学应用的模型提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张文本嵌入研究应超越表层语义，关注隐式语义，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型过于关注表层语义，忽视了隐式语义的重要性，导致在需要深层理解的任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过试点研究展示现有模型在隐式语义任务中的不足，并提出改进建议。

Result: 试点研究表明，即使最先进的模型在隐式语义任务中表现仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区转向更注重隐式语义的建模目标，改进训练数据和评估基准。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

*Li-Ming Zhan,Bo Liu,Zexin Lu,Chengqiang Xie,Jiannong Cao,Xiao-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果归因的框架，用于识别Transformer中与目标行为相关的注意力头，通过向量量化自编码器（VQ-AE）划分潜在空间，并评估行为相关性，实现了更精准的推理时干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖表面线索或临时启发式，导致模块选择不理想或结果偏离目标。

Method: 训练VQ-AE对注意力头的激活进行量化，划分行为相关与无关子空间，通过二元分类指标评估行为相关性。

Result: 在七个LLM和五个行为数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在真实性引导任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地选择行为相关注意力头，并展示了跨领域零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: CC-RAG通过整合零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，改进了RAG管道，以建模因果关系，提升LLMs在专业领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG管道缺乏对因果关系的结构化建模，导致在专业领域中推理能力不足。

Method: CC-RAG通过构建DAG（有向无环图）并使用前向/后向链进行结构化多跳推理。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪氏病两个领域中，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上优于标准RAG和零样本LLMs。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构使LLMs在专业领域中生成更准确和可解释的响应。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文窗口中存在性能退化问题，现有解决方案训练成本高，且统计行为和成本效益方法研究不足。

Method: 提出PCD方法，对比长文本和局部注意力的logits，利用大规模短到长训练的优势。

Result: PCD在长上下文基准测试中达到最先进性能，有效缓解注意力分数退化。

Conclusion: PCD是一种无需训练的高效方法，显著提升大语言模型在长上下文中的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM推理变得至关重要。现有方法依赖粗略的预测，准确性不足。

Method: 通过草稿模型预测token和KV对的重要性，提出SpecKV（优化KV缓存丢弃）和SpecPC（压缩提示token）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长上下文基准测试中准确性优于现有基线，同时保持内存、延迟和吞吐量的改进。

Conclusion: 草稿模型首次用于近似LLM推理加速，扩展了其用途，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分反映真实场景的复杂性，需开发更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计EIFBENCH基准，包含多任务和约束条件，并提出SegPO算法优化模型表现。

Result: 现有大语言模型在复杂指令下表现差异显著，需进一步优化。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH和SegPO为LLM在复杂环境中的应用提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Method: 引入mSTEB基准，涵盖语言识别、文本分类、问答和翻译任务，评估了Gemini 2.0 Flash、GPT-4o (Audio)等模型。

Result: 高资源与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）间性能差距显著。

Conclusion: 需更多投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在机器翻译中取得了进展，但其潜力尚未完全发挥。现有方法忽视了认知翻译研究的关键见解，如人类翻译的认知策略。

Method: TACTIC框架包含六个功能不同的智能体，分别负责起草、精炼、评估、评分、上下文推理和外部知识收集，模拟人类翻译的认知流程。

Result: 在FLORES-200和WMT24基准测试中，TACTIC表现优异，超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，平均提升0.6 XCOMET和1.18 COMETKIWI-23。

Conclusion: TACTIC通过认知理论指导的多智能体协作，有效提升翻译质量，为机器翻译领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLM的认知错误检测，但缺乏对其元认知能力（如自我错误意识）的深入分析，这对LLM的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出AutoMeco框架评估现有元认知指标，并设计MIRA策略（一种无需训练的马尔可夫内在奖励调整方法）优化这些指标。

Result: 在三个数学推理数据集和三个LLM上的实验表明，AutoMeco与Best-of-N验证相比具有合理性，且MIRA能更准确评估LLM的元认知能力。

Conclusion: AutoMeco和MIRA为LLM元认知能力的评估和改进提供了有效工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Conclusion: Know-MRI为LLMs知识机制分析提供了灵活、统一的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型成本高昂，且容易受主流文化和价值观影响，领域适应虽有效但计算成本高，限制了资源有限的研究团队的应用。

Method: 评估不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对训练速度和模型准确性的影响。

Result: 研究结果为关注能源效率、可访问性或硬件限制的环境提供了实用参考。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，可以在低资源环境中更高效地实现领域适应。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源重新训练，成本过高。

Method: 利用PCA处理多头注意力层的矩阵乘积，设计快速分解方法，并引入线性校准减少误差累积。

Result: 实验表明Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，性能优于基准。

Conclusion: Olica无需重新训练即可高效压缩LLM，保持性能。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online

efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are

### [30] [Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08479)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应检索方法Adaptive-$k$，通过动态调整检索段落数量，解决了固定检索量在开放域问答中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Self-RAG和Self-Route）在事实性问答中表现良好，但在聚合问答中表现不佳，因为最佳上下文大小未知且可变。

Method: Adaptive-$k$基于查询与候选段落相似度分数的分布，单次选择段落数量，无需微调模型或额外推理。

Result: 在事实性和聚合问答基准测试中，Adaptive-$k$性能优于固定检索基线，同时减少90%的令牌使用，仍保留70%的相关段落。

Conclusion: 动态调整上下文大小能显著提升问答系统的效率和准确性，适用于多种语言模型和嵌入模型。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文指出现有文本到图像生成评估框架的不足，提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注与人类判断的一致性，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 识别可靠评估应解决的两个关键方面，并通过实验证明当前主流框架的不足。

Result: 当前评估框架在多样化的指标和模型中未能完全满足可靠性要求。

Conclusion: 提出改进图像-文本对齐评估的建议。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

*Sumanth Manduru,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模审计了0.5至50亿参数的小型语言模型（SLMs），揭示了其公平性与性能的关系、架构对偏见的影响，以及量化压缩的复杂权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的快速应用，其伦理风险尚未被充分理解，因此需要系统评估其公平性和性能。

Method: 使用BBQ基准测试，在零样本提示下评估了9个开源SLMs（来自Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi系列），分析其在模糊和明确上下文中的实用性和公平性。

Result: 1. 公平性与性能可共存（如Phi模型）；2. 架构显著影响偏见（Qwen 2.5表现虚假中立，LLaMA 3.2存在刻板偏见）；3. 量化压缩带来复杂权衡（如4-bit AWQ提升性能但增加偏见）。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中公平高效的SLM部署提供了实用指导，特别适用于小型企业和资源受限场景。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的文化敏感性，尤其是对礼仪的理解和偏见，目前缺乏相关资源。

Method: 构建EtiCor++语料库，设计评估任务和偏见度量指标。

Result: 实验显示LLMs对某些地区存在固有偏见。

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估和改进LLMs的文化敏感性提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种一致性驱动的原型提示框架（GID），用于从新旧知识整合的角度解决广义意图发现问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法依赖标注数据且难以处理域外意图，现有GID方法忽视域适应问题。

Method: 结合原型提示框架（转移旧知识）和分层一致性约束（学习新知识）。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于基线，达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 方法有效且泛化性强，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的RAG知识冲突分类法，并创建了CONFLICTS基准，用于评估LLMs在解决冲突信息时的表现。实验表明，LLMs在冲突解决上仍有不足，但通过提示其显式推理可显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG方法中检索到的信息常存在冲突，但LLMs如何应对此类冲突尚不明确，因此需要系统研究和评估。

Method: 提出知识冲突分类法，并构建CONFLICTS基准，通过实验评估LLMs在冲突解决中的表现。

Result: LLMs在解决冲突信息时表现不佳，但通过显式推理提示可显著提升其回答质量。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步改进LLMs在RAG中处理冲突信息的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models
highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级后训练框架，通过对比推理反馈和残差嵌入细化策略优化潜在推理轨迹，显著提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）存在固定轨迹和显式输出开销问题，而潜在推理虽能避免这些问题，但缺乏有效的后训练更新机制。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）对比推理反馈，通过强/弱基线比较优化嵌入方向；2）残差嵌入细化，结合历史梯度实现稳定更新。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证有效性，MathQA准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: 框架显著提升推理性能，无需额外训练即可实现高效优化。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

TL;DR: 该研究利用机器学习方法分析语音嵌入，探索106种世界语言的关系，发现其与传统语言学方法结果一致，并展示了语言变化的动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言学方法依赖专家分析特定语言特征，而机器学习提供了一种大规模、数据驱动的替代方案，以更高效地探索语言关系。

Method: 使用XLS-R自监督语言识别模型生成语音嵌入，并通过线性判别分析（LDA）聚类语言，与传统语言学距离进行比较。

Result: 语音嵌入的距离与传统语言学距离高度一致，能够捕捉全局和局部的语言类型模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言变异的可扩展分析提供了新视角，未来可扩展到低资源语言和社会语言学变异的研究。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Result: 系统通过优化的TTS模型提升了兼容性和用户体验，同时减少了对外部组件的依赖。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，未来在狼人杀等游戏中，额外的组件可能不再必要。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Motivation: 评估LLM在心理健康支持中的实际表现，填补其在真实心理咨询场景中行为测试的空白。

Method: 开发CounselBench基准，包含专家评估（CounselBench-EVAL）和对抗性数据集（CounselBench-Adv），对LLM和人类治疗师的表现进行多维度评分。

Result: LLM在感知质量上优于人类治疗师，但常被专家标记安全隐患；LLM评委高估模型表现且忽视安全问题。

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的心理健康场景中LLM行为提供了临床基准框架，揭示了模型的一致性和特定失败模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，需一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL框架包含难度测量器和训练调度器，分阶段从易到难引入样本，并逐步提高损失函数温度。

Result: 实验表明POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据，有效提升了KD过程的稳定性和模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测具有主观性，且受个人特质影响。此前研究多关注社会人口因素，但人格特质对LLMs的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过人类标注调查验证MBTI维度对标注行为的影响，并在四个开源LLMs中应用MBTI人格提示，评估其在三个仇恨言论数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现人格提示导致显著差异，包括与真实标签的不一致、人格间分歧和逻辑层面的偏见。

Conclusion: 需谨慎设计人格提示，以确保LLM标注流程的公平性和与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学推理需要长链推理、领域术语知识和适应新发现，RAISE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: RAISE分为三步：问题分解、逻辑查询生成和逻辑检索，从非结构化语料库中检索逻辑相关文档。

Result: RAISE在科学推理基准测试中表现优于其他基线方法，检索的文档不仅领域知识相似，逻辑相关性也更强。

Conclusion: RAISE通过逻辑相关文档检索，提升了科学推理的性能。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的解码策略（如贪婪搜索、采样或重排序）缺乏对任务特定目标的显式优化，限制了控制能力。

Method: MEMETRON利用混合元启发式算法（GENETRON和ANNETRON）在LLM的响应空间中搜索，通过奖励模型和上下文操作引导。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排序方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了在不重训练模型的情况下提升对齐能力的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

*Mingyu Zheng,Zhifan Feng,Jia Wang,Lanrui Wang,Zheng Lin,Yang Hao,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableDreamer是一个渐进式、弱点导向的数据合成框架，用于解决LLM在表格指令调优中数据多样性和效率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成表格指令调优数据时，未能充分探索输入空间且忽视目标LLM的弱点，导致数据多样性和效率不足。

Method: 通过合成多样化的种子数据，并基于新识别的弱点数据迭代探索输入空间，最终生成用于微调的训练数据。

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率提升11.62%，优于使用更多数据的基线方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer通过弱点导向的数据合成，显著提升了表格指令调优的效果，且数据效率更高。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究肠道微生物组这一复杂且资源匮乏的生物医学领域中的关系提取问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行摘要生成以优化上下文，再通过指令调优生成关系。

Result: 摘要生成减少了噪声并引导模型，但BERT方法仍优于生成模型。

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源专业领域研究中具有潜力。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

*Yang Liu,Jiaqi Li,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RuleReasoner是一种通过动态采样增强小推理模型（SRMs）规则推理能力的方法，显著优于大型推理模型（LRMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小推理模型在多样任务和领域中规则推理的泛化能力问题。

Method: 采用强化学习和动态采样策略，通过历史奖励调整不同领域的采样权重。

Result: 在ID和OOD任务上显著优于前沿LRMs（ID任务提升4.1%，OOD任务提升10.4%），计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner证明了小模型在规则推理中的潜力，且无需人工设计的混合训练方案。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中的能源消耗问题，提出通过输出压缩和提示工程策略减少响应长度，从而显著优化能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域研究较少，因此探索减少响应长度的方法以优化能源效率。

Method: 首先对12种解码器LLM在5个数据集上进行基准测试，分析响应长度；然后定义六种信息类别评估响应质量；最后探索提示工程策略以减少响应长度。

Result: 适当的提示策略可减少25-60%的能源消耗，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 通过提示工程控制响应长度和信息内容是优化LLM能源效率的有效方法。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

TL;DR: ClimateViz是一个专注于科学图表事实核查的大规模基准数据集，包含近5万条与科学图表关联的声明，并评估了多模态语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查主要集中于文本和表格，忽略了科学图表的重要性。ClimateViz填补了这一空白，旨在推动图表推理的研究。

Method: 构建了包含49,862条声明和2,896个图表的ClimateViz数据集，标注支持、反驳或信息不足。评估了多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在图表推理上表现不佳，最佳模型（如Gemini 2.5和InternVL 2.5）准确率仅为76.2%至77.8%，远低于人类水平（89.3%至92.7%）。

Conclusion: ClimateViz为科学图表事实核查提供了首个基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并强调了结构化知识图谱解释的潜在价值。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfPO是一种基于训练策略置信度的偏好学习方法，专注于优化对偏好影响最大的关键token，无需额外模型或计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）对所有token进行均匀调整，而ConfPO旨在通过更高效地利用KL散度预算，提高对齐质量并避免过优化。

Method: ConfPO仅依赖训练策略的置信度来识别和优化偏好关键token，无需辅助模型或额外计算。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于均匀调整方法，且无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种简单、轻量且高效的方法，显著提升了LLM的对齐效果。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Motivation: 保证案例的合规检测面临法律和技术文本复杂、模型解释需求高以及数据有限等挑战。

Method: 利用多跳推理将保证案例的声明-论据-证据结构转化为可解释的合规检测，并通过大型语言模型生成保证案例。

Result: 通过GDPR要求的案例研究，验证了生成保证案例在多跳推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: NLI方法在自动化合规检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

Motivation: 尽管单语言语音情感识别已取得进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性。目标是训练一个能够处理多语言情感识别的统一模型。

Method: 采用语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，以Wav2Vec2.0为基础构建单语言教师模型，并将其知识蒸馏到多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集上加权召回率达72.9，芬兰语数据集上未加权召回率达63.4，优于微调和知识蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别悲伤和中性情绪上表现优异，但在愤怒和快乐情绪识别上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Result: 改进的代理方法优于现有方法（如程序思维），且更安全。

Conclusion: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理在无标签情况下表现更优，交互研究为未来工作提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Method: 开发分类器识别论文中的社会内容，分析跨学科与纯技术团队对社会议题的关注变化。

Result: 纯计算机科学团队越来越多地整合社会议题，涉及公平、安全、医疗等多个领域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了跨学科团队主导社会导向研究的假设，并引发对AI安全、治理及社会科学独特贡献的思考。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Method: 基于Transformer架构，使用单GPU训练，数据来源于Essential CANDU教材。

Result: 模型能捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本有时不连贯，展示了在核领域任务的实用性。

Conclusion: 未来需扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升模型在核领域的准确性，并评估其实际应用准备度。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away

Motivation: 核电厂操作数据查询需要高准确性和透明度，传统NL-to-SQL方法存在验证困难和复杂数据库结构的问题，导致信任度降低。

Result: 研究表明，功能库方法在准确性和可维护性上优于直接NL-to-SQL生成。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡了用户易用性和操作安全性，为关键系统数据检索提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,

benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent

Result: 基于语义搜索和LLMs的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%准确率）。微调后的LLaMA-2 70B达到79.4%，LLaMA-3 8B基础版为76.6%，GPT-4 Turbo最高（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 微调和先进模型（如LLaMA-3和GPT-4 Turbo）显著提升实体提取准确率，展示了模型快速发展的潜力。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SRB-300数据集，用于提升瑞士德语的低资源语音识别性能，通过微调Whisper模型显著降低了词错误率并提高了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式，现有数据集在自然对话语音中表现不佳，需要更真实的数据集来提升语音识别性能。

Method: 使用SRB-300数据集（300小时的真实广播录音）微调OpenAI Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后，词错误率降低19%-33%，BLEU分数提高8%-40%，最佳模型WER为17.1%，BLEU为74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法显著提升了瑞士德语语音识别的性能，对低资源语言具有重要价值。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLM防御中的几何盲点，提出ALKALI对抗基准和GRACE防御框架，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM防御无法应对快速增长的对抗威胁，尤其是潜在伪装攻击。

Method: 提出ALKALI对抗基准和GRACE框架，通过几何表示增强和潜在空间正则化防御攻击。

Result: GRACE框架将攻击成功率降低39%，并引入AVQI指标量化潜在对齐失败。

Conclusion: 潜在伪装是LLM的结构性盲点，GRACE和AVQI为防御和评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Result: PlantBert在实体类型上表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于低资源科学领域的稳健领域适应。

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展且可复制的框架，推动了计算植物科学的跨学科创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Method: 采用结构化流程，将复杂法律语言分解为原子片段，提取义务规则，并评估其语法和语义一致性。评估了多种LLM配置，包括提示工程、微调模型和多阶段流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，机器生成的DDL形式化与专家手工形式化具有良好一致性，有效提示的LLMs能显著提升法律信息学的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律文本语义分析中具有潜力，尤其是在有效提示下，能够为法律信息学提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（包括高资源语言的方言）在自然语言理解系统中的困难。

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示方法。

Result: 在希腊方言数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现先前研究仅依赖表层语言信息。

Conclusion: 新方法能捕捉更深层次的语义信息，为方言标准化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法有效传播注入知识，导致模型无法回答需要推理的问题。

Method: 采用超网络方法，扩展MEND的元目标，通过修改梯度更新实现知识传播。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在新数据集Controlled RippleEdit中，未见实体关系对上的性能仍优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现优越，但未见关系上的性能差距缩小，未来需进一步优化知识传播范围。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学推理等任务上表现优异，但其训练通常需要高昂的计算资源。本文旨在证明，通过优化技术，可以在资源受限的环境中实现高性能模型的训练。

Method: 结合强化学习和内存优化技术，在单张RTX 3080 Ti（16GB内存）上训练了一个1.5B参数的数学推理模型。

Result: 该模型在数学推理基准测试中表现优于或与更大规模的模型相当，且资源需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，高性能数学推理模型无需依赖大规模基础设施，为资源受限的研究者提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing
access to high-performance AI research.

Motivation: 现有检索增强语言模型在知识冲突时生成结果不忠实，现有方法通过强制抑制模型知识实现忠实性，但损害了模型内部知识结构。

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulRAG优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG通过显式建模知识冲突，提升了生成结果的忠实性，同时保留了模型的知识结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在政治领域中如何管理共同基础，尤其是在存在错误信息和高风险的情况下，以评估其在纠正用户错误信念方面的表现。

Method: 通过分析LLMs对直接知识问题和诱导性问题的回答，评估其是否能够主动纠正用户的错误信念，并结合其知识水平和政治偏见进行分析。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在共同基础和纠正错误信念方面存在显著挑战，引发对其在政治话语中减少错误信息作用的担忧。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治领域的共同基础管理和错误信息纠正能力有限，需进一步改进以应对相关挑战。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

Motivation: 现有方法在探测语言模型中的数值表示时效果有限，作者认为这是由于分布学习嵌入在表示精确数量时的固有不可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种新的探测技术，能够解码输入嵌入中的数值，并验证其准确性。

Result: 新方法在多种开源语言模型中实现了近乎完美的数值解码精度，证明模型能精确表示数字。此外，嵌入的精确性与算术错误显著相关。

Conclusion: 通过调整嵌入以符合探测发现的模式，可以减轻语言模型在基础算术中的错误。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Motivation: 早期检测对预防和延缓神经认知障碍（NCD）的进展至关重要，语言相关的fMRI可能是一种有前景的方法。

Method: 设计了一种自然语言任务的fMRI方法，结合机器学习和人口统计学特征（年龄、性别、教育年限）进行分类。

Conclusion: 自然语言任务的fMRI在早期检测认知衰退和NCD方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and

Result: 从GitHub项目中生成了16,061个训练实例和2,020个测试实例，实验显示该数据集显著提升了基于TDD的编码性能。

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD研究提供了高效的数据合成方法，并公开了代码、数据集和模型以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

Motivation: 扩展L2韩语的标注工作，解决形态句法结构对齐问题，提升标注和分析的准确性。

Method: 引入半自动化框架，通过XPOS序列识别形态句法结构并与UPOS对齐；扩充语料库；使用两种NLP工具包评估对齐效果。

Result: 对齐数据集提升了标注一致性和形态句法标注、依存分析的准确性，尤其在标注数据有限时效果显著。

Conclusion: XPOS-UPOS对齐框架有效提升了L2韩语标注和分析的准确性，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过采样多个答案并启发式聚合（如多数投票或验证器排名）可以提升LLM在数学领域的性能，但现有方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 训练一个紧凑的LLM（SSA），输入为多个样本的拼接序列，通过强化学习优化其输出最终答案的准确性。

Result: 在多个推理数据集上，SSA优于其他测试时扩展方法（如基于奖励模型的重新排序），并展现出跨样本集大小、基础模型和任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSA方法通过分离生成答案的LLM和分析聚合样本的LLM，能够高效地与黑盒模型输出结合，展现出广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Method: 比较人类与三种LLM对相同二语写作的词汇和句法修改。

Result: 两者均提升词汇连贯性，LLM修改更生成化，且三种模型结果高度一致。

Conclusion: LLM校对在词汇和句法修改上表现一致且生成性强，可能优于人类校对。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

TL;DR: Router-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态路由和聚合多个LLM的能力，优化复杂任务的性能与成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常仅支持单轮一对一映射，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势。

Method: Router-R1将路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的推理能力动态调用模型，并通过轻量级规则奖励指导学习。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，Router-R1表现优于多个基线，实现了性能与成本的优化。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习实现了多LLM的动态路由与聚合，为性能与成本权衡提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

Method: 比较视觉和文本任务的电路功能，分析数据表示差异，并提出将后期层视觉表示修补到早期层的干预方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均缩小了两种模态间性能差距的三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态性能差距的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的生物力学算法，结合人机交互机制，提高了AR手术导航中变形建模的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算效率和应对大解剖变化方面存在不足，影响AR手术导航的可靠性。

Method: 结合数据驱动的生物力学算法和外科医生交互提示，动态调整模型。

Result: 算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，交互提示后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了变形建模的效率和准确性，增强了外科医生与算法的协作，为更安全可靠的手术导航铺平了道路。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶在罕见和长尾场景中性能下降的问题，并克服现有视觉语言模型方法的局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段训练范式：1) 使用驾驶问答数据集训练视觉语言模型；2) 扩散规划器进行模仿学习；3) 强化学习微调扩散规划器。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中达到89.6 PDMS，超越之前视觉SOTA 5.6 PDMS。

Conclusion: ReCogDrive通过多阶段训练和强化学习，显著提升了自动驾驶在复杂场景中的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像系统训练数据偏向欧美文化，忽视全球南方文化，需量化评估其文化代表性。

Method: 利用Wikimedia知识图谱构建层次化数据集，通过文本条件的信息增益评估系统响应。

Result: CuRe评分与人类感知相似性、图文对齐和文化多样性判断高度相关。

Conclusion: CuRe为文化代表性提供了可扩展的评估工具，适用于多种图像编码器和文本到图像系统。

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,
and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at

Conclusion: IGraSS是一个通用且鲁棒的框架，可用于优化噪声地面真实数据并提升基础设施网络的遥感映射效果。

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

Result: SpINRv2显著优于经典和基于学习的基线方法，尤其在高频条件下。

Conclusion: SpINRv2为基于神经雷达的3D成像设立了新基准。

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

Motivation: 当前AI系统常忽略外科医生的个性化操作风格，而个性化建模对提升手术AI系统的性能至关重要。

Method: 通过离散扩散框架和VLA管道，将手势预测建模为结构化序列去噪任务，结合内窥镜视频、手术意图语言和隐私感知的外科医生身份嵌入。

Result: 在JIGSAWS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够准确重建手势序列并学习到每位外科医生的独特运动指纹。

Conclusion: 个性化嵌入虽提升性能，但也增加身份泄露风险，需在个性化与隐私风险间取得平衡。

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了预训练模型无需任务级训练即可进行关系理解的能力。

Conclusion: 展示了预训练视觉语言模型在开放世界场景图生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

Motivation: 解决原始DVP无法处理多物体场景及训练中图像空间损失函数导致的训练困难问题。

Method: 扩展DVP架构，引入潜在空间损失函数，并设计新基准数据集。

Result: 在重建质量和分解重叠物体方面优于基线模型MONet和LIVE。

Conclusion: 通过潜在空间损失函数显著提升训练效果，但可微分渲染在自编码器中仍有局限性。

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

TL;DR: 研究了使用现代仅解码器LLM作为文本编码器对文本到图像扩散模型的效果，发现多层归一化平均嵌入优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现代LLM作为文本编码器的潜力，以改进文本到图像生成模型的性能。

Method: 构建标准化训练和评估流程，训练27个模型，分析不同文本嵌入的影响。

Result: 多层归一化平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示的对齐效果，多数LLM表现优于T5基线。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器能有效提升文本到图像生成的质量和推理能力。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

Motivation: 解决湿地监测中人工标注卫星图像成本高、耗时长的问题。

Method: 采用深度聚类和负采样的自监督训练方法，并实现集成模型以减少方差。

Result: 自监督集成模型在测试集上的IOU指标比全监督单模型提高了0.02。

Conclusion: 自监督方法在减少标注需求的同时，能够有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

Method: 利用单目深度估计将2D关键点提升到3D空间，构建连续规范流形，无需显式3D监督或相机标注。

Result: 模型在未见关键点上显著优于监督基线，且无监督基线在不同数据集间泛化时表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效学习鲁棒对应关系，同时揭示了无监督方法在跨数据集泛化中的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估现有基准测试是否真正衡量了视觉语言模型的组合理解能力，并发现其设计中的潜在问题。

Method: 方法包括分析基准测试的设计选择（如数据来源和构建过程），并比较简单启发式方法与CLIP模型的性能。

Result: 结果显示基准测试存在分布不对称性，导致简单启发式方法与CLIP模型表现相当，未能有效衡量组合理解能力。

Conclusion: 结论是基准测试设计需改进以减少偏见，并提出了构建更稳健基准的建议。

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

Motivation: 探索1D图像标记器在高度压缩下仍能实现精细图像编辑和生成的潜力。

Method: 利用向量量化的1D标记器，通过启发式操作和梯度优化的测试时标记调整，结合重建或CLIP相似性损失函数。

Result: 实现了多样化和逼真的图像生成，支持修复和文本引导编辑。

Conclusion: 1D标记器的高压缩性和表达性为图像编辑和生成提供了高效且灵活的新方法。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

TL;DR: Mirage是一种音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频内容，尤其擅长生成人物讲话的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法要么忽略音频专注于无声图像序列生成，要么局限于特定应用领域（如重新配音）。Mirage旨在解决这一问题，实现音频与视频的和谐集成。

Method: Mirage采用基于自注意力的统一训练方法，支持从零开始训练或基于现有权重训练，保留了音频到视频生成的通用性。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，能够逼真地呈现人物讲话的表现力。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了一种通用且高质量的方法，特别适用于人物讲话内容的生成。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制在计算复杂度上存在挑战，线性注意力无法有效聚焦，因此需要一种既能高效计算又能保持聚焦能力的新方法。

Method: 通过数学定义广义注意力，设计SEMA机制，利用token定位避免分散，并通过算术平均捕获全局注意力。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上，SEMA在图像分类任务中表现优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力机制，适用于大规模图像任务。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and

natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a
Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which
contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in
the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and
benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、地物稀疏分布和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: 设计了STNet，其核心是空间-光谱Transformer模块，通过解耦空间和光谱注意力及双门控机制，实现高效特征提取与融合。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上表现优于主流方法，减少了小样本和高噪声场景的过拟合风险。

Conclusion: STNet在不增加网络深度或宽度的情况下提升了模型表示能力，为高光谱图像分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网球等球拍运动中，击球点定位对分析球员表现和个性化装备设计至关重要，但现有方法存在内存消耗大和人工误差问题。

Method: 通过事件相机高效捕捉亮度变化，结合传统计算机视觉技术和原创事件处理（PATS）分三步识别击球点。

Result: 实验结果在测量网球运动员表现的允许范围内，计算时间满足实时应用需求。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实时定位击球点，适用于长时间监测球员表现。

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,
and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are
utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at
impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results
of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis
players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for
real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无分类器引导方法需要两倍于无条件生成的步骤，导致成本显著增加，而现有的自适应引导方法缺乏分析和实证支持。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，将无分类器引导限制在前几个去噪步骤中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和文本对齐方面表现良好，平均加速20%至30%，且适用于不同设置和模型。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单、通用的自适应引导策略，显著提高了效率且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

Conclusion: MedMoE证明了模态专用视觉表征在临床视觉-语言系统中的价值。

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the

that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with
an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND
progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual
hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical
analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of
multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting

Conclusion: 通过结合物理模型和深度学习，RadioDUN在无线电地图估计中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Result: 研究发现单模态质量评估方法可能低估关键样本，而生成的任务特定描述能有效统一多模态任务为文本模态。

Conclusion: SCALE为VLM数据选择提供了一种高效方法，提升了模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应低通引导（ALG）方法，解决了图像到视频（I2V）生成中动态性不足的问题，显著提升了视频的动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V生成方法因过早暴露高频细节导致视频动态性不足，ALG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过自适应调制输入图像频率内容，在去噪早期应用低通滤波。

Result: ALG显著提升了视频动态性（VBench-I2V测试中动态度平均提升36%），同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: ALG是一种简单有效的改进方法，显著提升了I2V生成的动态性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码自编码器（MARMOT）的自监督预训练模型，用于非视距（NLOS）瞬态成像任务，通过Transformer架构学习特征并预测完整测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在NLOS场景中主要优化体积密度或表面重建，缺乏从数据集中学习先验知识的能力。MARMOT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过扫描模式掩码（SPM）从部分掩码的瞬态数据中学习特征，并预测完整测量。

Result: 在合成数据集TransVerse（50万3D模型）上预训练后，MARMOT在下游任务中表现出色，定量和定性结果均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MARMOT为NLOS瞬态成像提供了一种高效的自监督预训练方法，能够通过特征迁移或解码器微调适应下游任务。

Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities
such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm
in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an
object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved
sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用的上下文感知对比学习框架（UniCaCLF），用于解决多媒体取证领域中的时间伪造定位（TFL）问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注伪造音视频内容的检测，但忽视了视频部分片段被篡改的情况，而时间伪造定位（TFL）在实际应用中更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: 提出UniCaCLF框架，利用监督对比学习通过异常检测识别伪造片段，并引入上下文感知感知层和自适应上下文更新器，增强伪造片段特征的区分性。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，UniCaCLF显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: UniCaCLF为时间伪造定位提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法存在冗余注意力和多模态对齐不足的问题，影响了视频时间定位的准确性。

Method: MLVTG结合MambaAligner（使用Vision Mamba块建模时间依赖）和LLMRefiner（利用预训练LLM的特定层增强语义对齐），无需微调即可优化多模态对齐。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG表现优于现有基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过双对齐策略（时间建模和语义净化）显著提升了视频时间定位的精度。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多尺度特征学习和语义场景理解的框架，用于动态环境中的视觉定位，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中光照、天气和移动物体等因素干扰视觉定位，现有绝对姿态回归方法难以保持一致性。

Method: 采用分层Transformer与跨尺度注意力融合几何细节和上下文线索，结合语义监督训练网络。

Result: 在TartanAir数据集上，该方法在动态物体、光照变化和遮挡等挑战性场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度处理与语义指导的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒视觉定位提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance
cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose
regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric
details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to
environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with
semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural
information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments
on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression
methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes,
and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with
semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in
real-world dynamic environments.

TL;DR: LiftVSR是一种高效的视频超分辨率框架，通过结合动态时间注意力和注意力内存缓存，显著降低了计算成本并提升了长期一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时间一致性和计算成本上存在不足，尤其是长视频处理需要大量GPU资源。

Method: 提出混合时间建模机制，包括动态时间注意力（DTA）和注意力内存缓存（AMC），并结合非对称采样策略。

Result: 在多个VSR基准测试中表现出色，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: LiftVSR在效率和性能上取得了平衡，为视频超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上，TrajFlow在多项关键指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TrajFlow为安全关键的自动驾驶应用提供了高效、准确的运动预测解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on
the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Conclusion: 研究为深度网络表示形成提供了结构化理论，有助于提升AI的鲁棒性、公平性和透明度。

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Result: 模型在未见用户数据上表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无校准跨主题EMG识别提供了新视角，并展示了在任务无关生物识别中的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Result: 生成的FCA-R2R数据集显著提升了多个VLN代理的性能。

Conclusion: FCA-NIG无需人工标注即可生成高质量训练数据，推动细粒度跨模态学习。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，保留权重多样性以提升蒸馏性能恢复。

Result: 实验表明，DGMR方法在多个先进视觉变换器上实现了57%以上的参数和FLOPs减少，性能几乎无损。

Conclusion: DGMR方法高效减少了模型参数和计算量，适用于大规模视觉变换器，且性能恢复效果显著。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）和对抗鲁棒性蒸馏（ARD）存在鲁棒公平性问题，即模型对某些类别的鲁棒性较强，而对其他类别较弱。

Method: 提出ABSLD方法，通过为不同类别分配不同温度参数，调整软标签的平滑度，减少学生模型在不同类别上的误差风险差距。

Result: 实验表明ABSLD在鲁棒性和公平性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ABSLD是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，可提升对抗性鲁棒公平性。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据不足时深度学习模型性能下降的问题，推动数据高效深度学习的发展。

Method: 组织数据受限挑战赛，限制参与者使用少量数据从头训练模型，禁止迁移学习。

Result: 成功方案结合了Transformer与CNN的大模型集成、强数据增强及先验知识方法。

Conclusion: 结合先验知识和创新方法可显著提升数据不足时的模型性能。

Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well.
In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which
Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by
organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep
Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges.
These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for
computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training
models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed
to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of
novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data
efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of
large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data
augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some
entries.

### [123] [SAMSelect: A Spectral Index Search for Marine Debris Visualization using Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08613)
*Joost van Dalen,Yuki M. Asano,Marc Russwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMSelect是一种算法，用于从多光谱图像中选择最佳的三通道可视化组合，以帮助海洋科学家更直观地识别海洋漂浮物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋漂浮物在中等分辨率图像中难以可视化，而专家通常依赖经验和启发式方法选择波段。SAMSelect旨在通过自动化选择最佳波段组合来解决这一问题。

Method: SAMSelect利用Segment Anything Model在小标注数据集上选择分类准确率最高的波段或指数组合，假设最佳分割结果也提供良好的视觉信息。

Result: 在加纳阿克拉和南非德班的Sentinel-2场景中测试，SAMSelect发现了新的未使用波段组合（如B8和B2的归一化差异指数），性能优于文献中的指数。

Conclusion: SAMSelect为海洋科学家提供了一种有效的可视化工具，并开源了代码库，有助于提升视觉解译效率。

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的NeRF方法，通过隐式表面表示和3D图像投影空间的概率密度函数，实现更精准的采样和渲染，同时引入新的表面重建损失函数，提升3D重建和图像渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因可扩展性问题无法对所有输入数据进行训练，导致采样效率低。本文旨在通过更精准的采样策略和损失函数优化渲染效果。

Method: 利用隐式表面表示建模3D图像投影空间的概率密度函数，实现针对性采样；提出新的表面重建损失函数，结合近表面和空空间信息。

Result: 在现有神经隐式表面渲染器中集成新方法后，3D重建和图像渲染的准确性和细节显著提升，尤其在感兴趣区域。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过改进采样和损失函数，显著提升了NeRF的渲染和重建性能，为3D场景建模提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级高效CNN-Mamba网络（ECMNet），用于语义分割，结合CNN和Mamba的优势，通过增强的双注意力块和多尺度注意力单元提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN和Transformer在语义分割中表现优异，但全局上下文建模仍不足。Mamba在视觉任务中展现出长距离依赖建模的潜力，因此结合CNN与Mamba以弥补各自弱点。

Method: 设计了增强双注意力块（EDAB）和多尺度注意力单元（MSAU），并提出了Mamba增强的特征融合模块（FFM），以整合多尺度特征和提升分割精度。

Result: 在两个代表性数据集上表现优异，Cityscapes和CamVid测试集的mIoU分别达到70.6%和73.6%，参数量为0.87M，计算量为8.27G FLOPs。

Conclusion: ECMNet在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡，验证了CNN与Mamba结合的有效性。

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,
dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based
framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a
Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M
parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频条件下机器人学习中数据稀缺和跨平台泛化问题。

Method: 通过分割机器人手臂并训练非配对GAN模型进行翻译，再结合扩散模型增强视频连贯性和运动真实性。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，RoboSwap在结构连贯性和运动一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoboSwap为机器人学习提供了可靠的跨体现数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis
and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues
to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式表示的快速且精确的无组织点云表面重建算法，解决了现有方法在细节和速度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法要么需要逐对象训练的小模型（细节高但泛化差），要么是大模型（泛化强但细节差且推理慢），需要一种兼顾速度和精度的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的隐式表示方法，通过三个关键贡献实现：1) 延迟查询点特征提取；2) 并行多尺度网格表示；3) 跨尺度注意力机制。

Result: 新方法在速度上优于所有基线方法，性能仅略低于最先进方法，实现了最佳的精度-速度权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和精度上取得了显著平衡，适用于通用3D形状重建。

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了3D生成模型朝向不一致的问题，为下游任务提供了更实用的生成结果。

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,
guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative
models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在预测视频记忆性时未能充分利用运动线索，且运动特征表示在微调阶段因缺乏标注数据而受损。本文旨在改进运动特征表示并探索视频记忆性预测的应用。

Method: 引入TMCCL模型，利用文本描述相似性构建正负运动样本集，增强运动特征表示；提出MWCVS方法，利用视频记忆性预测减少视频摘要标注的主观性。

Result: TMCCL在两个视频记忆性预测数据集上达到最优性能；MWCVS在两个视频摘要数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TMCCL显著提升了视频记忆性预测的准确性，MWCVS展示了视频记忆性预测在视频摘要中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、物理信息化的方法（NPM），用于模拟不同光照条件下的原始图像，以估计设备间的转换，解决了多相机颜色一致性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 多相机系统中，由于传感器和光学器件的差异，实现颜色一致性是一个挑战，现有方法在适应性、计算成本或实用性上存在局限。

Method: 采用Neural Physical Model（NPM），通过模拟指定光照下的原始图像来估计设备间的转换，支持物理测量初始化和有无配对数据的训练。

Result: 在NUS和BeyondRGB等公开数据集上，NPM表现优于现有方法，实现了跨传感器和光学系统的稳健颜色一致性。

Conclusion: NPM是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于多相机系统的颜色一致性需求。

Abstract: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential
for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in
modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and
optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor
adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical
requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping
fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight,
physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified
illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively
adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical
measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on
public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across
different sensors and optical systems.

Result: LLaVA-c在持续预训练和微调中提升基准性能并保持通用能力。

Conclusion: 首次证明任务级持续学习可媲美多任务联合学习，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Motivation: CLIP在细粒度和区域级理解上表现不足，影响了其在密集预测任务中的效果。当前方法往往牺牲语义一致性来提升细粒度对齐。

Method: 提出Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS)，通过自蒸馏过程利用模型自身的知识，在无标签图像上优化CLIP视觉编码器的表示。

Result: 在开放词汇对象检测和语义分割任务中，ATAS显著优于基线CLIP模型。

Conclusion: ATAS通过同时增强语义一致性和细粒度对齐，为开放词汇密集预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

Result: 多模态输入模型表现优于单模态输入，在2023年野火季节的F1分数达到60.3%。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型在高分辨率和大陆尺度野火预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in

In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances
Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms.
VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search
tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a
comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward
mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of
sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues,
all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting
methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy
of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction
for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法通过运动作为隐式监督信号，显著提升了动态场景中的特征学习效果。

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-
and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging
due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they
rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,
and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We
propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense
point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By
leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion
trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based
optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly
available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出TraGraph-GS方法，通过轨迹图实现大规模场景的高精度渲染，解决了现有方法在相机轨迹和纹理细节上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模场景时存在相机轨迹适应性和纹理细节失真的问题，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于图的场景分区方法，结合正则化约束和渐进渲染策略，减少高斯重叠导致的失真。

Conclusion: TraGraph-GS显著提升了大规模场景的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过大规模基准测试评估三类3DGS方法（基于场景优化、无场景优化和通用方法），并引入新数据集。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made
public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

*Dieuwertje Alblas,Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Kaj O. Kappe,Marieke Hofman,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SE(3)-对称变换器模型的方法，用于预测腹主动脉瘤（AAA）的生长，通过保留血管表面的解剖结构和几何保真度，实现个性化监测策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AAA监测基于最大直径，忽略了3D形状与生长的复杂关系，导致标准化监测间隔可能不适用。个性化生长预测可优化监测策略。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面预测AAA生长，结合局部多物理特征。训练数据为24名患者的113次CTA扫描。

Result: 模型预测AAA生长的中位直径误差为1.18 mm，并能以0.93的准确率预测患者是否在两年内需手术修复。外部验证集表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于血管表面的局部定向AAA生长预测可行，有助于个性化监测策略。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

*Yuhang Wang,Jun Li,Zhijian Wu,Jianhua Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InceptionNeXt在图像分类和下游任务中表现优异，但存在空间依赖性和局部建模不足的问题。InceptionMamba通过正交带卷积和Mamba模块解决了这些问题，实现了高效全局上下文建模和卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InceptionNeXt在空间依赖性和全局上下文建模方面存在局限性，需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 提出InceptionMamba架构，采用正交带卷积替代传统一维条带卷积，并引入瓶颈Mamba模块增强全局上下文建模。

Result: 在分类和下游任务中，InceptionMamba实现了最先进的性能，且参数和计算效率优越。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba通过改进空间建模和全局上下文融合，显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

### [141] [RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772)
*Jiayi Song,Kaiyu Li,Xiangyong Cao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的半监督语义分割框架RS-MTDF，通过多教师蒸馏与融合方法，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的语义分割依赖大量标注数据，但标注成本高昂。半监督学习（SSS）虽能缓解数据依赖，但现有方法因标记与未标记数据分布不匹配而泛化能力不足。

Method: RS-MTDF利用预训练的VFMs（如DINOv2和CLIP）作为教师模型，通过特征级蒸馏将学生模型特征与教师模型对齐，并在解码器中融合知识以增强判别能力。

Result: 在ISPRS Potsdam、LoveDA和DeepGlobe数据集上的实验表明，RS-MTDF性能优于现有方法，尤其在LoveDA上不同标注比例下表现突出，并在多数语义类别中取得最高IoU。

Conclusion: 多教师VFM指导显著提升了遥感分割的泛化能力和语义理解，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

*Keyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian2Scene是一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的自监督学习框架，用于点云预训练，解决了现有方法在内存需求和3D几何结构捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法依赖隐式场景表示和高内存需求，且重建目标仅应用于2D空间，难以捕捉3D几何结构。

Method: 采用3DGS进行预训练，分两阶段训练：第一阶段通过双分支掩码自编码器学习2D和3D场景表示；第二阶段利用重建点云和高斯基元的几何位置监督学习。

Result: 在多个下游3D目标检测任务中表现优于现有预训练方法。

Conclusion: Gaussian2Scene通过3DGS提高了几何理解能力，降低了计算负担，为3D视觉任务提供了更高效的预训练框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat数据提供了标准化评估工具，并证明SSL4EO-L预训练的GFM在性能上优于ImageNet。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth
imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress
towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and
BigEarthNet-L.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法仅适用于完全对齐的数据集，而真实工业环境中的数据通常未对齐，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 提出HomographyAD方法，包括输入前景对齐、自同构学习微调模型，以及基于特征距离的异常检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升现有异常检测方法的性能。

Conclusion: HomographyAD为真实工业环境中的异常检测提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法在单图像去雾中表现优异，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

Motivation: 传统Rectified Flow的直线路径限制了采样空间多样性，且多尺度噪声建模能力不足。

Method: 提出Discretized-RF，将路径离散化为动量场子路径，并在速度上引入噪声以改变方向。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样且高效的轨迹，并持续产生高质量和多样化的结果。

Conclusion: Discretized-RF通过动量场和速度噪声的引入，显著提升了模型的多样性和噪声建模能力。

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation
-- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to
novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce
HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework.
HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise
inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and
motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer
(MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally
consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we
integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in
interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally,
HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and
interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

TL;DR: HiSin是一种基于扩散模型的高效正弦图修复框架，通过分辨率引导的渐进推理降低内存和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率正弦图修复对CT重建至关重要，但现有扩散模型因高内存和计算需求难以处理高分辨率输入。

Method: HiSin采用分辨率引导的渐进推理，先在低分辨率提取全局结构，再在高分辨率处理小补丁，并结合频率感知补丁跳过和结构自适应步骤分配。

Result: 实验表明，HiSin峰值内存使用减少31.25%，推理时间减少18.15%，且修复精度不受影响。

Conclusion: HiSin是一种高效且精确的高分辨率正弦图修复方法。

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型在视觉内容生成中的普及引发了对文化表现准确性的担忧，需系统评估其文化对齐能力。

Method: 引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域，通过983个提示、3637张图像和10k+人工标注进行评估。

Result: T2I模型平均44%未满足文化期望，显性期望失败率68%，隐性期望49%，现有评估指标与人类判断相关性差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型的文化表现缺陷，为开发更具文化意识的模型和评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining
superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It
employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and
often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals.
Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer
vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image
analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences
between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome
these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language
foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for
vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text
refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of

Motivation: 空间转录组学数据获取成本高，大规模数据难以获得，因此需要一种高效的方法从现有图像数据中预测基因表达。

Method: 采用对比学习框架的深度学习方法，从全切片图像预测基因表达，并在六个疾病数据集上评估性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了基因间相关性，还适用于小样本数据集，并在基于生物标志物表达的癌症组织定位中显示出潜力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker
expression.

*Zike Wu,Qi Yan,Xuanyu Yi,Lele Wang,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamSplat是一个实时处理未校准视频流并生成动态3D高斯泼溅表示的框架，解决了现有方法在实时性、动态建模和长期稳定性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理未校准输入、实时动态建模和长期稳定性，StreamSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出静态编码器中的概率采样机制和动态解码器中的双向变形场，实现高效动态建模。

Result: 在静态和动态基准测试中，StreamSplat在重建质量和动态建模上优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat是首个完全前馈的框架，能够高效处理未校准视频流并生成动态3D场景表示。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: DiscoVLA是一种参数高效的方法，用于解决CLIP模型在视频-文本检索中的视觉、语言和对齐差异问题，通过特征融合和对齐蒸馏显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注视觉差异，忽略了语言和对齐差异，导致CLIP在视频-文本检索中的性能受限。

Method: 提出Image-Video Features Fusion和Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation，分别解决视觉、语言和对齐差异。

Result: 在MSRVTT数据集上，DiscoVLA以CLIP（ViT-B/16）为基础，R@1达到50.5%，优于之前方法1.5%。

Conclusion: DiscoVLA通过同时解决三种差异，显著提升了视频-文本检索的性能。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

Conclusion: 该框架为异构知识的整合提供了有效的训练无关解决方案，适用于复杂的视觉生成任务。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

TL;DR: WetCat是一个专为自动化技能评估设计的湿实验室白内障手术视频数据集，填补了现有资源在全面技能评估方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湿实验室培训依赖人工评估，效率低且主观性强，计算机视觉技术为自动化评估提供了可能。

Method: 通过高分辨率视频记录和详细的阶段注释、语义分割，构建WetCat数据集，支持关键手术阶段的技能评估。

Result: WetCat数据集为开发可解释的AI评估工具提供了基础，并推动了客观、可扩展的手术教育。

Conclusion: WetCat为眼科培训中的自动化工作流程分析和技能评估设立了新标准。

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets
a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in
ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in
Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

Result: MIRAGE在分类和分割任务中优于通用和专用基础模型及分割方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE适合作为开发稳健眼科AI系统的基础，模型和评估基准已开源。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE
and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双曲特征增强方法局限于封闭环境，无法处理开放环境中的未见类别。

Method: 采用神经ODE模块和元学习估计特征分布，引入正则化保持层次结构，推导损失上界以支持无限增强。

Result: 在五项开放环境任务中显著提升双曲算法性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强了双曲算法在开放环境中的表现。

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

TL;DR: 论文提出SkipVAR框架，通过动态跳过冗余步骤和替换无条件分支，显著提升VAR模型的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VAR模型的高频组件或后期步骤导致推理延迟，但计算冗余尚未深入分析。

Method: 提出自动跳过步骤策略和无条件分支替换技术，并结合频率信息动态选择加速策略。

Result: SkipVAR在GenEval基准上实现1.81倍加速和2.62倍速度提升，平均SSIM达0.88。

Conclusion: 频率感知的自适应加速策略有效提升了可扩展的自回归图像生成效率。

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and
has been publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力的方法，通过学习的二进制注意力掩码确保只有关注的图像区域影响预测，解决了上下文导致的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文可能强烈影响物体感知，尤其是在物体出现在分布外背景时，可能导致有偏表示。同时，许多图像级任务需要识别相关区域，通常需要上下文。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段处理完整图像以发现物体部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段利用输入注意力掩码限制其感受野到这些区域，实现聚焦分析并过滤潜在虚假信息。两阶段联合训练，第二阶段可优化第一阶段。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段注意力方法有效解决了上下文导致的偏差问题，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Motivation: 研究是否可以通过搜索机制在不重新训练现有非推理模型的情况下，激发其隐藏知识并生成长推理链。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现一致提升，MMMU-PRO总体提升2%，其中文科领域显著提升9%。

Conclusion: 通过搜索机制可以在非推理模型中成功诱导长推理链，无需额外训练或监督。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual
agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks
face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity,
extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of
multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce
OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an
automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through
subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on
the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework
that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive
tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k
graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance
rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently
guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional
evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their
performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future
advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.

Conclusion: SSS通过半监督学习和SAM-2的结合，显著提升了医学图像分割性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

Motivation: 解决跨光谱人体识别中的挑战，尤其是可见光与红外图像匹配问题，并探索遮挡对性能的影响。

Method: 采用预训练的ViT模型，引入SIE编码域和相机信息，并在IJB-MDF数据集上分析遮挡影响。

Result: 仅编码相机信息即可在LLCM数据集上实现最优性能，遮挡分析填补了现有研究的空白。

Conclusion: SIE中的相机信息对跨光谱匹配至关重要，遮挡问题需进一步研究以提升VI-ReID性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral
evaluations.

segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for

supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Motivation: 小目标检测性能远低于大目标，是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。

Method: 使用Fast AutoAugment快速找到最优数据增强策略。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

TL;DR: ORIDa是一个大规模真实世界图像合成数据集，包含30,000多张图像和200个独特对象，支持对象合成任务的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏多样性和规模，无法全面探索真实场景中的对象合成问题。

Method: ORIDa提供两种数据类型：事实-反事实集（每组5张图像）和事实场景（单张图像），涵盖多样环境和对象位置。

Result: ORIDa是首个公开的具有如此规模和复杂性的真实世界图像合成数据集。

Conclusion: ORIDa为对象合成研究提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of
diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the
rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and
scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce
ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique
objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa
has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

TL;DR: ADAM是一种无需训练的自发现与标注模型，利用LLM和CLIP在开放世界中标注新物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统目标检测模型依赖预定义类别、无法识别开放世界中新物体的问题。

Method: 结合LLM生成候选标签和CLIP视觉嵌入构建ELR，通过频率投票和跨模态重排序标注新物体，并引入自优化循环提升一致性。

Result: 在COCO和PASCAL数据集上，ADAM无需微调即可有效标注新类别。

Conclusion: ADAM为开放世界目标标注提供了一种无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome
this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model,
a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级模块化框架，通过改进LiDAR分割的初始处理模块，提升其在恶劣天气下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于范围视图的LiDAR分割方法在恶劣天气下的泛化性能不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种双分支框架，分别处理几何属性和反射强度，并引入GAS和RDC模块抑制噪声和校正失真。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在恶劣天气下的性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际环境中的LiDAR分割提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia
experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due
to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

TL;DR: ALTA是一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模模型在视觉表示上表现优异但难以直接匹配跨模态。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），结合时间多视角放射影像输入，提升视觉-语言对齐效果。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅高效，还提升了视觉和语言理解能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

### [171] [Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991)
*Anudeep Das,Gurjot Singh,Prach Chantasantitam,N. Asokan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成模型中概念替换技术（CRTs）的局限性，特别是在图像到图像（I2I）场景中的失效问题，并提出了一种新方法AntiMirror以提升效果和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）在文本到图像（T2I）任务中表现优异，但在避免生成不可接受内容（如侵权或冒犯性内容）方面仍面临挑战。现有CRTs在T2I中有效，但在新兴的I2I场景中效果不佳，亟需解决这一差异。

Method: 首先通过I2I模型实证现有CRTs的失效，提出CRTs应具备保真度（保留输入中的其他概念），并开发了AntiMirror技术以实现这一目标。

Result: 实验表明，现有CRTs在I2I中无法真正删除不可接受概念，而AntiMirror在替换不可接受内容的同时保持了其他概念的保真度。

Conclusion: CRTs在I2I场景中需重新设计以兼顾效果和保真度，AntiMirror为此提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuScenes数据集上，性能提升显著，最高达+5.9 mAP（+45%）。

Conclusion: SDTagNet通过充分利用SD地图信息，显著提升了在线高精地图构建的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

Result: 预训练MIL模型在不同器官和目标任务中表现优于从头训练模型，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MIL模型具有强大的适应性，迁移学习可显著提升计算病理学任务性能，并提供了标准化资源。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational
pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings
from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly
supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医疗影像）部署ML模型时，需要检测训练中未见过的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出了Isolation Network框架，通过解决二分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度，并进一步扩展为DIsoN，支持无数据共享的模型参数交换。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即远程、安全地利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dispersive Loss的简单正则化方法，用于改进扩散生成模型，无需额外数据或参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展独立发展。本文旨在通过Dispersive Loss填补这一差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，鼓励隐空间中的内部表示分散，类似于对比自监督学习，但无需正样本对。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上评估，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss有效改进了扩散生成模型，有望连接生成建模与表示学习。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also

TL;DR: ASVR提出了一种联合学习视觉和文本模态的自回归框架，通过重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观，显著提升了多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏视觉细节及难以表达视觉内容。

Method: 引入自回归语义视觉重建（ASVR），在统一的自回归框架中联合学习视觉和文本模态，重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观。

Result: ASVR在多种数据规模和LLM骨干上表现优异，显著提升了多模态理解性能，如LLaVA-1.5在14个基准测试中平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 自回归重建语义表示能稳定提升多模态理解，而重建原始外观则无益甚至有害。ASVR为视觉语言模型提供了一种有效的联合学习方法。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于统一幅度规律的自适应缓存策略（MagCache），显著加速视频扩散模型，同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法依赖启发式跳过时间步或缓存特征，需大量校准且易因提示过拟合导致输出不一致。

Method: 发现残差输出幅度比单调递减规律，设计MagCache自适应跳过不重要时间步，仅需单样本校准。

Result: 在Open-Sora和Wan 2.1上分别实现2.1x和2.68x加速，LPIPS、SSIM和PSNR指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MagCache高效且鲁棒，显著提升视频扩散模型性能。

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for

### [180] [TIP-Search: Time-Predictable Inference Scheduling for Market Prediction under Uncertain Load](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08026)
*Xibai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIP-Search是一种实时市场预测框架，动态选择深度学习模型以满足严格延迟需求，提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频金融系统对延迟要求严格，需在不确定工作负载下实现低延迟预测。

Method: 离线分析延迟和泛化性能，在线动态选择模型，无需显式输入标签。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上表现优于静态基线，精度提升8.5%，100%满足截止时间。

Conclusion: TIP-Search在不确定环境下实现低延迟金融预测效果显著。

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling
framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated
by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search
dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to
maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints.
Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then
performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain
labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets
(FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms
static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline
satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust
low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cognitive Weave的新型记忆框架，通过多层次的时空共振图（STRG）管理信息，显著提升了任务完成率和查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统在结构灵活性、时间感知和从原始数据中提取高层次洞察方面存在局限，需要更先进的记忆架构来支持持续学习和动态适应。

Method: 采用多层次的时空共振图（STRG）管理语义丰富的洞察粒子（IPs），并通过语义预言接口（SOI）动态丰富IPs。通过认知精炼过程合成更高层次的知识结构（IAs）。

Result: Cognitive Weave在长期规划任务、动态问答场景和多会话对话连贯性方面表现优异，任务完成率平均提升34%，查询延迟降低42%。

Conclusion: 论文展示了Cognitive Weave的优越性能，并探讨了其伦理意义和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SOP-Bench基准测试，用于评估LLM在复杂工业SOP任务中的表现，发现当前LLM代理能力与实际需求存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂工业SOP任务中表现不足，且缺乏公开的基准测试。

Method: 提出合成数据生成框架，创建SOP-Bench基准，并评估两种代理架构。

Result: Function-Calling和ReAct代理的平均成功率分别为27%和48%，工具调用错误率高。

Conclusion: LLM代理能力与实际工业SOP需求差距大，需领域特定优化。SOP-Bench开源以推动社区扩展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

Motivation: 解决ASP在处理细粒度时间约束时的可扩展性问题。

Method: 利用ASP的差异约束扩展，将时间相关部分外部处理。

Result: 实现了不受时间精度影响的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ASP在时间约束下的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

Conclusion: 神经压缩技术在天体物理数据压缩中具有潜力，未来可探索有损压缩方法。

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

Motivation: 开发一个能够与学生自然交互、验证数学证明并提供指导的智能辅导系统，以提升数学学习效率。

Method: 系统由三个模块组成：自动形式化/证明检查器、下一步生成器和自然语言反馈生成器，分别负责验证证明、生成下一步策略和提供反馈。

Result: 自动形式化模块在正确证明中准确形式化了57%的策略，在错误证明中准确识别了30%的错误步骤；反馈生成器在准确性和相关性上优于简单基线。

Conclusion: LeanTutor展示了LLM在数学辅导中的潜力，尤其在形式化验证和自然语言反馈生成方面表现良好。

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for
math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally
verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and
provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three
modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

TL;DR: ORFS-agent是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的迭代优化代理，用于自动化硬件设计流程中的参数调优，显著优于传统贝叶斯优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路设计流程涉及大量参数配置，微小变化可能对设计性能、功耗和面积产生重大影响，需要高效优化方法。

Method: ORFS-agent通过自适应探索参数配置，结合LLM进行高维优化任务，实现资源效率和设计指标的提升。

Result: 在两个技术节点和多个电路基准测试中，ORFS-agent将布线长度和有效时钟周期改善了13%以上，同时减少40%的优化迭代次数。

Conclusion: ORFS-agent提供了一个灵活、可解释的多目标优化框架，且模块化设计使其可无缝集成到任何前沿LLM中。

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

TL;DR: FloorplanMAE是一个自监督学习框架，用于从不完整的平面图预测完整平面图，提高设计效率。


<details>

Motivation: 在建筑设计过程中，平面图设计是动态迭代的，预测完整平面图可帮助建筑师快速生成初步设计，减少重复修改的工作量。

Method: 提出基于Masked Autoencoders (MAE)的方法，通过掩码部分平面图并训练轻量级Vision Transformer (ViT)来重建缺失部分。

Result: 实验表明，FloorplanMAE能从不完整平面图生成高质量的完整平面图，优于现有基准。

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE为平面图生成提供了可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

Result: 方向向量的幅度调节推理强度，修改其可改变推理标记数量和性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs推理的内部机制，并提供了控制推理行为的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Conclusion: 该框架能高效扩展分类法对齐，同时保持高质量映射，并在模糊案例中保留专家监督。

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

### [195] [Hybrid Reasoning for Perception, Explanation, and Autonomous Action in Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08462)
*Christos Margadji,Sebastian W. Pattinson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIPHER是一个结合视觉-语言-动作（VLA）的模型框架，用于工业控制，通过混合专家知识和推理实现人类式决策，适用于数据稀缺环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程需要鲁棒性和适应性，但传统AI依赖标注数据且泛化能力有限，而基础模型缺乏工程精度。

Method: CIPHER整合过程专家、回归模型和检索增强生成技术，支持物理知识驱动的链式推理，无需显式标注。

Result: 模型在分布外任务中表现优异，能解释决策并生成精确指令，适用于工业环境。

Conclusion: CIPHER为自主系统提供了精确、透明和可信的工业部署基础。

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

*Rahatara Ferdousi,M Anwar Hossain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为RHealthTwin的框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗健康领域应用中存在的幻觉、偏见和伦理问题。通过动态结构化输入和反馈机制，该框架提高了响应的安全性、相关性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗健康领域的应用潜力巨大，但存在幻觉、偏见、透明度和伦理问题。为响应世界卫生组织等机构的建议，作者提出了一个负责任的技术框架。

Method: RHealthTwin框架通过Responsible Prompt Engine（RPE）动态结构化输入，减少幻觉风险，并结合反馈机制优化提示结构。

Result: 在四个健康领域（心理支持、症状分诊、营养规划和活动指导）中，RPE在BLEU、ROUGE-L和BERTScore等指标上表现优异，伦理合规和指令遵循率超过90%。

Conclusion: RHealthTwin为负责任地应用LLM于健康和福祉领域提供了前瞻性基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

TL;DR: FedTAIL是一个联邦领域泛化框架，通过梯度对齐优化和类感知正则化解决长尾分布和优化冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长尾类分布和冲突优化目标下表现不佳，FedTAIL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合梯度一致性正则化、类感知锐度最小化和曲率感知动态加权，增强条件分布对齐。

Result: 在标准领域泛化基准测试中，FedTAIL实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FedTAIL在集中式和联邦设置下均有效，尤其在领域偏移和标签不平衡情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Method: 结合DRL与LLM推理，实现安全、合规且经济可行的路径规划。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据收集率、避障、成功着陆、法规合规性和能源效率等方面显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低空经济网络约束下的无人机轨迹规划关键挑战。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HGformer的分层图Transformer框架，用于解决两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中的资源分配问题，通过结合增强的图Transformer编码器和分层决策模型，显著提升了资源分配效率和对抗收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏由于阶段间的顺序依赖性和图拓扑的复杂约束，难以实现全局最优策略。

Method: 提出HGformer框架，结合增强的图Transformer编码器和分层决策模型，并设计了一种分层反馈强化学习算法。

Result: 实验表明，HGformer在复杂动态游戏场景中显著优于现有方法，提升了资源分配效率和对抗收益。

Conclusion: HGformer为解决复杂动态对抗环境中的资源分配问题提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Petri网展开的实时部分序对齐方法FoldA，解决了传统对齐方法在并发行为表示和状态空间爆炸方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法在处理高选择性和并发性模型时会导致状态空间爆炸，且无法充分表示并发行为。

Method: 使用定向Petri网展开实时计算部分序对齐。

Result: 在485对合成模型-日志和19对真实/基准模型-日志上验证，FoldA减少了排队状态数量并更准确地表示并发。

Conclusion: FoldA虽然计算时间较长，但在减少状态空间和提高并发表示准确性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Result: 在未见动态、运动学和拓扑结构的机器人上，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了机器人控制的泛化能力。

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Conclusion: CoVo为无监督推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Motivation: 由于测量限制，实际场景中的变量常被离散化，直接应用条件独立性检验会导致错误结论。现有方法通过二值化处理推断潜在变量的独立性，但会损失信息。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法在多种数据集上表现出优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了信息损失，显著提升了条件独立性检验的性能。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而基于知识的因果发现（如通过变量元数据推理）是一种有潜力的替代方案。然而，现有LLM方法的结果不稳定且不一致，影响可靠性。

Method: 通过知识图谱（KGs）识别信息丰富的元路径子图，并利用学习排序模型优化子图选择，将排名靠前的子图融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数上比大多数基线方法高出44.4分，且适用于多种LLM和KGs。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基于知识的因果发现的可靠性和效果，为复杂系统中的多变量交互分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Conclusion: 未来研究应更全面地评估LLM在数据科学中的应用，包括数据管理、探索性活动、人机协作和任务转型。

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

Result: 在四个经典MOCOP基准测试中，POCCO表现出显著优越性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: POCCO通过自适应模型选择和偏好优化，有效提升了多目标组合优化问题的解决效果。

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的模拟器和评估方法为交叉路口行为模拟提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NKGs能高效表示复杂事实，但链接预测任务尚未有系统综述，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 系统分类现有方法，分析其性能和应用场景。

Result: 总结了NKGs链接预测的现状，并提供了方法比较。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的潜在方向，为NKGs链接预测领域的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline
promising directions for future research.

*Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AbstentionBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定情况下拒绝回答能力的基准测试，覆盖20个数据集。研究发现，模型扩展对提升拒绝回答能力帮助有限，且推理微调反而会降低该能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为确保LLMs在现实场景中可靠部署，需要研究其在不确定或无法回答时的拒绝能力，但目前缺乏系统性评估框架。

Method: 引入AbstentionBench基准，评估20个前沿LLMs在多种问题类型（如未知答案、模糊问题等）下的拒绝回答表现。

Result: 研究发现拒绝回答能力仍是一个未解决的问题，模型扩展和推理微调对其帮助有限，甚至可能降低表现。

Conclusion: AbstentionBench的发布旨在推动LLM可靠性研究，当前模型在不确定性推理方面仍有不足。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在动态环境中协作的挑战，尤其是视觉驱动的推理和多样化体现的支持不足问题。

Method: 提出VIKI-Bench基准测试和VIKI-R框架，后者结合预训练视觉语言模型和强化学习。

Result: VIKI-R在所有任务层级上显著优于基线方法，并展现出异构智能体的组合协作模式。

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench和VIKI-R为具身AI系统中的多智能体视觉驱动协作提供了统一的测试平台和方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Method: 利用AtCoder Heuristic Contests的真实任务设计基准测试，支持交互式代理架构和测试反馈。

Result: 前沿LLMs在特定问题上表现优异，但在跨问题一致性和长期问题解决能力上仍落后于人类。

Conclusion: ALE-Bench有助于推动AI在算法工程领域的未来发展。

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有设计方法在处理非可微评估、多变拓扑和连续布局空间时存在不足，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: DCIDA通过联合训练的采样策略生成设计决策，并利用注入式映射将原始设计动作转换为物理表示。

Result: 实验表明，DCIDA的Transformer策略网络在复杂传递函数情况下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路逆设计提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data

performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在代码生成等任务中表现优异，但复杂符号推理任务尚未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 定义了最坏情况符号约束分析任务，并通过SMT约束求解和专门设计的符号约束数据集对LLMs进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，3B规模的WARP-1.0-3B模型在性能上超越基线模型，甚至优于更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: LLMs具备深入符号推理的潜力，支持神经网络学习与形式化方法的紧密结合。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

Motivation: LLMs在代码生成和理解方面表现出色，但在复杂软件工程任务中精度低且可解释性差，需要改进。

Method: Repeton采用分步补丁和测试流程，结合轻量级启发式方法和开发工具，避免依赖嵌入检索系统。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中，Repeton在补丁有效性和可解释性上优于RAG方法。

Conclusion: 通过模块化和可验证的任务分解，Repeton为可扩展且透明的自主调试提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

Conclusion: 研究为代理设计提供了新见解，有助于开发更高效且更符合人类开发实践的代理。

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

Result: 37.02%的MR存在偏差，排除后ML模型性能提升53.33%，特征重要性显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究为优化代码审查提供了分类、检测方法和实证支持，有助于提升分析可靠性。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于铁电畴开关研究，还可推广到其他复杂设计空间的探索。

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的文档质量对查询扩展效果至关重要，但现有方法成本高且计算密集，需改进。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，采用改进的互逆排名融合方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合高级稀疏检索器达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在稀疏检索查询扩展中表现优异，具有高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Method: 设计了HLG索引结构，包含原子命题追踪、潜在主题聚类和跨文档实体链接；并开发了两种互补的检索方法。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验显示，该方法比传统RAG平均提升了23.1%的检索召回率和正确性。

Conclusion: HLG和配套检索方法有效解决了跨文档语义距离问题，并通过开源工具包推广使用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

*Michael Färber,David Lamprecht,Yuni Susanti*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将RDF知识图谱（KGs）与图神经网络（GNNs）全面整合的方法，以提升推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF知识图谱，但其丰富的语义信息在基于GNN的推荐系统中尚未充分利用。

Method: 通过结合RDF对象属性的拓扑信息和数据类型属性的内容信息，评估不同GNN在推荐任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF KGs的语义信息显著提升了推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在开放数据云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we

*Fan Xu,Luis A. Leiva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态检索中的特征对齐问题，比较了不同相似性度量方法的效果，发现Wasserstein距离和余弦相似性表现最佳，并指出传统架构在多模态交互中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态检索中不同模型表示同一概念时的变异性，以及如何通过特征对齐解决跨模态检索问题。

Method: 分析视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，使用四种标准相似性度量和两种学习度量进行特征对齐，并评估其效果。

Result: Wasserstein距离可作为模态差距的度量，余弦相似性在特征对齐任务中表现最佳，传统架构无法捕捉多模态交互的复杂性。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态信息检索提供了新见解，特别适用于现实世界的跨模态应用。

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

TL;DR: 为大一工科生设计的跨学科AI课程，涵盖技术与社会影响，提升学生对AI的理解与认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工科生缺乏AI基础及其社会影响认知的问题。

Method: 课程分为三个模块，由工程与人文学科教师联合授课，内容涵盖AI的环境、社会和职场影响。

Result: 学生AI认知提升，包括环境意识增强和公平问题解决能力提高。

Conclusion: 跨学科课程设计有效提升学生对AI的综合理解。

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our
lives.

Conclusion: 神经网络（如MLPC）在数据效率上表现优异，特征选择和可解释方法对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast
students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with
behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron
classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across
all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI
models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines
surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through
comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys
were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar
and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed
demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only).
The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021
and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in
2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this,
familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for
AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical
concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing
accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the
primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and
structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption.
Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of
respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to
integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are
evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data
science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and
infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical
frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential.

large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United
States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor
collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the
course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student
feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor.
Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit
analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify
frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time
awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom
instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete

potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of
engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition
methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVmix是一种针对KV Cache的混合精度量化方法，通过梯度重要性分析和动态优化策略，显著降低内存占用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理时KV Cache的高内存需求限制了其在资源受限平台上的部署，现有方法无法动态优化精度分配。

Method: KVmix利用梯度重要性分析分配层特定比特宽度，动态优化长上下文任务中的KV对精度。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral上，KVmix实现了近无损推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理速度提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix为LLMs的高效部署提供了一种可调平衡精度与效率的解决方案。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT)模型，用于解决部分域适应问题，通过样本级和类级传输的统一框架提升知识转移的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应问题需要对齐跨域样本并区分异常类，现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，对聚类结构探索不足且易受预测不准确影响。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，结合样本级和类级传输的合作机制，利用标签感知传输成本确保局部传输结构，并推导快速计算形式以提高效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT通过统一的双层传输框架有效解决了部分域适应问题，提升了知识转移的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法未有效抑制大型语言模型（LLM）的偏见，且依赖离线数据，无法适应动态分布变化。MBPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MBPO通过对抗性扰动生成硬负样本，构建离线偏好数据集，并利用封闭任务生成在线验证奖励，结合GRPO训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，MBPO能显著提升LMMs在视觉语言任务中的性能，并有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MBPO通过模态平衡偏好优化，为LMMs的任务适应性和对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Motivation: 研究如何在预训练中利用低精度表示（如MX格式）提高效率，同时避免因舍入模式导致的模型发散问题。

Method: 提出了一种改进的舍入模式（round-to-infinity），用于计算MXFP8格式的缩放因子，并在8B模型和15T tokens的数据集上进行验证。

Result: 改进的舍入模式成功实现了在MXFP8格式下对8B模型的预训练，避免了发散问题。

Conclusion: MX格式的低精度表示在预训练中具有潜力，但需谨慎选择舍入模式以确保收敛。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

Motivation: 现有方法在块缺失数据场景中提取特征效果不佳，且静态图结构限制了处理非平稳交通数据的灵活性。

Method: 提出混合专家框架（MoE）捕获时空特征及其权重，设计低秩引导采样图注意力机制（LrSGAT）动态平衡路网相关性。

Result: 在四个交通数据集上的实验表明，STAMImputer性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAMImputer有效解决了交通数据填补中的块缺失和动态空间相关性挑战。

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at

Result: 对于文本生成和线性分类任务，给出了数据集规模的数学界限，证明了理论可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了理论基础，实际技术（如检索增强生成）可连接理论与应用。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性标量化方法无法处理非线性、非加性的公平目标（如Nash社会福利或最大最小公平），离线环境中缺乏统一优化方法。

Method: FairDICE利用分布校正估计，联合优化福利最大化和分布正则化，无需显式偏好权重或穷举搜索。

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线MORL中的非线性福利优化提供了稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution是一种高效、无偏的数据标注和训练框架，显著提升数据集构建效率。

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

Motivation: 电力价格预测对电力现货市场交易决策至关重要，但现有生成式AI和时间序列基础模型在EPF中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用2024年德国、法国、荷兰、奥地利和比利时的日前拍卖电价数据，对比了多种TSFMs与传统统计和机器学习方法。

Result: Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，与传统方法相当，但双季节性MSTL模型在各国和评估指标中表现最稳定。

Conclusion: TSFMs在EPF中表现良好，但MSTL模型仍是最优选择，未来需进一步优化TSFMs。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

Motivation: 传统算法（如k-NN）在监督微调（SFT）后表现优于神经网络本身，但因其不可微分性难以直接整合到SFT中。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA的性能优于密集层预测和基于SFT嵌入的k-NN回归。

Conclusion: NONA为将传统算法整合到SFT提供了可行方案，显著提升了回归任务的性能。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

TL;DR: UniVarFL是一种新的联邦学习框架，通过两种正则化策略解决非IID数据导致的性能下降问题，无需依赖全局模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非IID数据导致联邦学习性能下降，传统方法成本高或适应性差。

Method: UniVarFL采用分类器方差正则化和超球面均匀正则化，模拟IID训练动态。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，UniVarFL在准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Motivation: 探索自动驾驶领域中运动预测和规划模型的性能如何随计算资源增加而提升，以及如何优化模型和数据规模以实现最佳性能。

Method: 使用50万小时驾驶数据集，分析模型性能与计算预算的关系，研究模型参数和数据规模的优化比例，并探讨推理时计算效率。

Conclusion: 优化训练和推理时的规模特性是提升自动驾驶模型性能的关键，同时利用其他代理的驾驶数据可缓解机器人数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Conclusion: 框架为LLM提取的RWD提供严格透明的评估方法，推动行业标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Conclusion: 提出的零参数方法简化了等变网络的实现，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击脆弱性问题，目前尚无模型能同时解决这两者。

Method: SHIELD通过超网络生成针对特定数据的动态子网络，并结合区间算术提供严格的安全保证。

Result: SHIELD在增强安全性的同时保持网络适应性，解决了持续学习中的安全问题。

Conclusion: SHIELD为持续学习中的安全性和适应性提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Result: 实验表明，Bingo在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，实现了效率和准确性的平衡。

Conclusion: Bingo证明了通过训练可以显著提升语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，HC-RLHF能高概率生成安全模型，并在无害性和有用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HC-RLHF提供了一种理论保证和实际效果兼具的语言模型对齐方法。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Conclusion: L-STEP是一种高效、适应性强的时空位置编码方法，显著提升了图深度学习框架的预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.

Result: ECON在六个基准测试中平均性能提升11.2%，并具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为更强大的多LLM协作提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

Method: 设计了AR-Bench，包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题和猜数字），模拟现实场景，测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 当代LLMs在主动推理上表现不佳，难以获取或利用必要信息，且现有改进策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发新方法（如交互学习、实时反馈）提升主动推理能力，AR-Bench已公开。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Conclusion: DPSDP通过多智能体协作和分布外泛化显著提升性能。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Edoardo Cetin,Tianyu Zhao,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)，通过密集奖励训练教师模型，以优化下游蒸馏效果，避免了强化学习的探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法依赖于模型初始化的探索能力，且推理语言模型的主要用途是作为教师模型用于蒸馏新学生模型，而非直接部署。

Method: RLTs框架通过提供问题和解决方案的提示，训练教师模型生成详细解释，并通过密集奖励（基于学生模型对解释的理解）优化教师模型。

Result: 7B规模的RLT在竞赛和研究生级任务中表现优于现有蒸馏和冷启动方法，且适用于更大规模学生模型和零样本任务。

Conclusion: RLTs框架提高了强化学习推理的效率与可重用性，为推理语言模型的训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

*Waiss Azizian,Michael Kirchhof,Eugene Ndiaye,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,Pierre Ablin,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的“真理几何”方法在任务间缺乏可迁移性，线性分类器在不同任务中表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs表现出强大的泛化能力，但其可靠性仍受质疑。现有方法通过分析激活状态判断答案正确性，但本研究指出其任务依赖性限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过实验验证线性分类器在不同任务中的表现，并尝试使用稀疏正则化和混合探针等方法改进，但效果有限。

Result: 发现“真理几何”方法在任务间无法迁移，分类器支持集几乎不重叠，激活向量在不同任务中形成明显分离的簇。

Conclusion: 现有方法在任务间的可迁移性存在根本性限制，需进一步研究更通用的可靠性评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

*Vamshika Sutar,Amandeep Singh,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用深度学习和数据增强技术解决气旋快速增强事件检测中的类别不平衡问题，并验证了空间坐标作为输入特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气旋快速增强是一种极端且罕见的事件，导致数据集类别不平衡，传统机器学习模型难以处理。

Method: 结合深度学习、集成学习和数据增强框架，生成模拟气旋的空间坐标和风强度数据以解决类别不平衡问题，并使用深度学习模型进行分类。

Result: 数据增强显著提升了快速增强事件的检测效果，空间坐标是关键输入特征。

Conclusion: 研究为时空数据中极端事件的合成数据生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

Method: 结合UNHCR的ProGres注册数据、Google Open Buildings的建筑足迹和OpenStreetMap的地点坐标，使用标签传播算法生成高精度难民统计数据。

Result: 成功将超过1000万难民观测数据分配到网格单元，识别出局部流离失所模式。

Conclusion: 高分辨率数据集为深入研究流离失所的驱动因素提供了基础。

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics
from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan
African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with
satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location
coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm
creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This
methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee
observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of
localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and
national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a
foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SQOG，通过平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO）在凸包及其邻域（CHN）内增强Q函数泛化能力，解决了离线强化学习中分布偏移导致的Q值高估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，分布偏移导致Q值对分布外（OOD）动作的高估，现有方法因约束过强而限制了Q函数泛化。

Method: 提出平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO），在CHN内通过平滑OOD Q值与邻近样本Q值更新Q值。

Result: SQOG在D4RL基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了接近准确的Q值估计。

Conclusion: SQOG通过SBO有效缓解了过约束问题，提升了Q值估计和策略改进效果。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HASFL框架通过自适应控制批量大小和模型分割，解决了分裂联邦学习中的异构设备性能问题，提升了训练效率和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分裂联邦学习方法因边缘设备性能异构性导致严重的滞后效应，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出HASFL框架，基于收敛边界理论自适应调整批量大小和模型分割，平衡通信计算延迟与训练收敛。

Result: 实验验证HASFL在多种数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: HASFL有效解决了异构设备环境下的分裂联邦学习问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

### [261] [e3: Learning to Explore Enables Extrapolation of Test-Time Compute for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09026)
*Amrith Setlur,Matthew Y. R. Yang,Charlie Snell,Jeremy Greer,Ian Wu,Virginia Smith,Max Simchowitz,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为e3的方法，通过训练LLM进行上下文探索，以提升推理能力并实现性能外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型在性能外推（即超出训练时的最大token预算时仍能提升性能）方面表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: e3方法包含三个关键要素：(1) 链式技能组合（如验证与生成）；(2) 利用错误轨迹的负梯度增强探索；(3) 通过课程设计将任务难度与训练token预算结合。

Result: e3-1.7B模型在AIME'25和HMMT'25上表现最佳，能够外推到2倍训练token预算，并提升了pass@1和pass@k分数。

Conclusion: 通过上下文探索训练LLM可以有效提升推理能力和性能外推，e3方法为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

TL;DR: TAWM是一种基于时间感知的世界模型，通过动态调整时间步长提升任务动态学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型固定时间步长无法适应不同频率的任务动态，TAWM通过时间感知优化采样率。

Method: TAWM通过训练多样化的时间步长（Δt）来学习高低频任务动态，基于信息论优化采样率。

Result: TAWM在多种控制任务中表现优于传统模型，数据效率和性能均有提升。

Conclusion: TAWM的时间感知设计显著提升了模型适应性和效率，适用于多样化控制问题。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

TL;DR: MOBODY是一种基于模型的离线强化学习算法，通过生成目标域的合成转换数据来解决源域和目标域动态不匹配的问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线强化学习方法在源域和目标域动态不匹配时表现受限，无法探索目标域超出离线数据集的范围。

Method: MOBODY通过表示学习发现跨域的共享潜在状态和转换表示，生成目标域的合成数据，并引入Q加权的行为克隆损失稳定训练。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，MOBODY显著优于现有方法，尤其在挑战性场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MOBODY通过模型生成和表示学习解决了动态不匹配问题，为离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforced RCSL通过引入“in-distribution optimal return-to-go”机制，解决了传统RCSL缺乏拼接能力的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RCSL因依赖离线数据集的质量而性能受限，缺乏拼接能力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Reinforced RCSL框架，利用策略识别当前状态下可达到的最佳未来回报，避免复杂的回报增强技术。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果均表明，Reinforced RCSL优于标准RCSL，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL是一种简单且有效的方法，解决了RCSL的局限性，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges
the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了获取可证明充分解释的效率，并提供了网络预测的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络预测提供了高效且可证明的解释，同时支持不同抽象级别的细粒度分析。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

Method: 提出FedLeak方法，包含部分梯度匹配和梯度正则化两项新技术，并设计基于文献和行业实践的实际评估协议。

Result: FedLeak在现实FL环境中仍能实现高保真数据重构，揭示了FL系统的重大漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了FL系统中存在的显著隐私风险，呼吁开发更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of
generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual

processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex
correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions
even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we
further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable
contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather

TL;DR: PBFM是一种新的生成框架，通过显式嵌入物理约束（PDE残差和代数关系）到流匹配目标中，提高了物理残差的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常从数据中隐式学习物理规律，缺乏对物理约束的显式建模。

Method: 提出PBFM框架，结合流匹配损失和基于物理的残差损失，无需调整超参数权重，并引入时间展开训练策略。

Result: 在三个代表性PDE问题上，PBFM的物理残差比传统流匹配方法精确8倍，且在分布准确性上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程应用中的代理建模、不确定性量化和加速模拟提供了高效且理论完备的框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Result: JoFormer在Tiny Shakespeare任务中实现更低困惑度和更快收敛。

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer中位置信息整合提供了理论支持，具有潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型ChannelTokenFormer，用于解决多变量时间序列数据中的通道依赖、异步采样和缺失值问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列数据通常存在通道依赖、异步采样和缺失值问题，而现有模型往往基于过于简化的假设，无法有效应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出了ChannelTokenFormer模型，通过灵活的架构设计显式捕捉跨通道交互，适应通道异步采样，并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，ChannelTokenFormer在复杂现实条件下具有更强的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决多变量时间序列数据中的实际问题提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对变分自编码器图像压缩的额外微调训练步骤，通过在推理阶段对量化潜在表示进行重新训练，提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中对量化的近似处理不准确，导致网络性能次优，因此需要改进。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对网络部分进行基于量化潜在表示的微调训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在均匀标量量化和熵约束量化中均能带来额外编码增益，Kodak和TecNick测试集的比特率平均节省1%-2.2%。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的微调训练，可以在不增加推理复杂度的情况下显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境提供了一种高效、轻量的SLM增强方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VAE-LF为智能电网中的电力负荷管理提供了高效的数据补全解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in
smart grids.

Conclusion: R-ICE为动态LLM路由和碳核算等应用提供了实用解决方案，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索策略在强化学习中至关重要，但现有方法如动作扰动可能不够高效。RRP旨在通过奖励扰动补充现有方法，提升探索能力。

Method: RRP在环境奖励中添加零均值噪声，与动作扰动方法（如ε-greedy、随机策略）兼容，实现轻量级集成。

Result: 实验表明，RRP显著提升了PPO和SAC的性能，提高了样本效率并帮助逃离局部最优。

Conclusion: RRP是一种通用、高效的探索策略，通过奖励扰动与噪声驱动探索的理论联系，为强化学习提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically

sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query

gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing

SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention
block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse

Conclusion: InFOM通过建模状态分布和用户意图，显著提升了强化学习预训练的效果，为RL的大规模预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Conclusion: 数据高效策略在奖励模型优化中潜力巨大，为低资源RLHF应用提供了强健解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，Edit Flows在图像描述任务上优于自回归和掩码模型，在文本和代码生成任务上显著优于掩码构造方法。

Conclusion: Edit Flows通过编辑操作实现了更灵活的序列生成，为非自回归模型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

*Sizhe Dang,Yangyang Guo,Yanjun Zhao,Haishan Ye,Xiaodong Zheng,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速零阶优化器，通过减少前向传递次数和并行处理，显著提高了优化速度和内存效率，性能优于MeZO，接近Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时保持优化速度。

Method: 采用批量单边估计和自适应步长调整，结合CUDA并行处理，减少前向传递次数。

Result: FZOO在11个任务中平均比MeZO准确率提高3%，前向传递减少3倍；RoBERTa-large上准确率提升5.6%，前向传递减少18倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU高效微调，为内存高效预训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

TL;DR: Agentic Neural Network (ANN) 提出了一种动态多智能体协作框架，通过类似神经网络的层状结构和两阶段优化策略，显著提升了任务处理的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统依赖静态配置，限制了复杂任务的动态处理能力。ANN 旨在通过神经网络的启发，实现更灵活、高效的多智能体协作。

Method: ANN 采用两层优化策略：前向阶段动态分解任务并构建协作团队；反向阶段通过反馈优化全局和局部协作，使智能体自我进化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ANN 表现优于现有多智能体基线，展示了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: ANN 提供了一个可扩展、数据驱动的多智能体框架，结合了 LLM 的协作能力和神经网络的高效灵活性，未来将开源。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

TL;DR: ChemGraph是一个基于AI的框架，用于自动化计算化学和材料科学的工作流程，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型，简化复杂任务的执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原子模拟在化学和材料科学中至关重要，但由于方法多样、软件复杂且需要专业知识，执行这些模拟具有挑战性。

Method: ChemGraph利用图神经网络和大型语言模型，提供自然语言界面，支持多种计算任务和方法。

Result: 在13个基准任务中，小型LLM在简单任务中表现良好，复杂任务需更大模型；通过多代理框架分解任务，小型模型可匹配或超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过AI和多代理框架，显著提升了原子模拟的效率和可访问性。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Motivation: 提升早期药物发现中Caco-2渗透性预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 系统研究了八种分子特征表示类型（如2D/3D描述符、指纹等）结合AutoML技术，评估了不同数据集上的模型表现。

Result: PaDEL、Mordred和RDKit描述符效果显著，AutoML模型CaliciBoost表现最佳，3D描述符使MAE降低15.73%。

Conclusion: AutoML方法在ADMET建模中有效，为数据有限的任务提供了特征选择指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MasHost表现优于现有方法，验证了其有效性、效率和结构合理性。

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主Mas图构建框架，为多智能体系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue
modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations
of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate
surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue
grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented
learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft
tissue simulation in surgical applications.

Motivation: 为了将2D图像或视频流实时转换为3D光场，提供更真实的3D体验。

Method: 使用MiDaS CNN从单张2D图像提取深度图，结合AI技术优化性能，支持多种输入源（图像、视频、桌面区域）。

Result: 实现了实时3D光场合成，支持多平台GUI，可直接输出至光场3D设备。

Conclusion: 扩展后的altiro3D库功能更强大，适用于多种3D应用场景。

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such
as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a
Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has
been also implemented. Sources available at:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从动态视频中高效重建关节物体，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: 该方法为几何对齐、物理真实的3D全息场景表示提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light
waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes
complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed
improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step
towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene
representations.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster

rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for
selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer
and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable
selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

*Franck Meyer,Kyunghoon Hur,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MD-ViSCo是一个统一的框架，能够从单一输入波形生成多种目标波形（如ECG、PPG或ABP），避免了为每种波形对设计独立模型的需求，提高了临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常针对特定波形对设计，导致需要多个模型和流程，限制了临床应用的便利性。

Method: MD-ViSCo结合了1-D U-Net和Swin Transformer，利用AdaIN捕捉波形风格，实现多方向波形生成。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，MD-ViSCo平均降低了MAE 8.8%，提高了PC 4.9%，生成的ABP波形满足AAMI和BHS标准。

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo提供了一个统一的框架，能够用单一模型处理多种生命体征波形，提升了医疗监测的效率。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Conclusion: 该研究为端到端LALM提供了有效方案，并验证了基于分词的声码器对性能提升的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and
multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical
awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as
line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival
estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来文本到音乐生成系统的设计和训练提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of
using \textit{CALL}.

Conclusion: Re4MPC为高自由度机器人的运动规划提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning
paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic
environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations
and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with
deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for
uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to
new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models,
robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel
situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid
neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of
autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and
accelerate their development.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

Motivation: 生成模型在机器人操作中因能建模多模态动作分布而被广泛应用，但其多步采样的高推理成本限制了实时性。现有方法借鉴图像生成的加速技术，但忽视了机器人动作的时间依赖性。

Method: 提出FreqPolicy，通过频率一致性约束和自适应一致性损失，使基于流的视觉运动策略有效捕捉时间结构，实现高效的一步动作生成。

Result: 在3个仿真基准的53个任务中表现优异，集成到VLA模型后在40个任务中实现加速且性能无损，实际机器人任务中推理频率达93.5Hz。

Conclusion: FreqPolicy通过频率一致性约束显著提升生成模型在机器人操作中的效率和性能，适用于实时系统。

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging
the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector

*Siyuan Yang,Cheng Song,Zhilu Lai,Wenjia Wang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: KP-PINNs框架通过RKHS范数和KP方法改进PINNs的损失函数，提升稳定性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs使用L2损失函数在复杂方程中表现不稳定，需改进。

Method: 提出KP-PINNs框架，利用RKHS范数重新定义损失函数，并用KP方法加速计算。

Result: 理论证明KP-PINNs稳定，数值实验显示其高效解决微分方程。

Conclusion: KP-PINNs为提升PINNs稳定性和准确性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

*Wenlong Meng,Shuguo Fan,Chengkun Wei,Min Chen,Yuwei Li,Yuanchao Zhang,Zhikun Zhang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，针对AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和模型参数更新实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本离散性导致的不可微分问题，并适应不同语言模型架构的检测器。

Method: 引入加权嵌入、暖启动方法、分词器推断和模型提取技术。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上优于现有攻击方法，成功应用于商业检测器。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据中文本表达风格的差异是主要漏洞，并提出防御策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

TL;DR: 论文研究了生成式AI（特别是LLMs）在网络安全访问控制系统中的应用，重点评估了LLM生成密码策略的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但其输出的不一致性和不可预测性在安全关键领域（如访问控制）中带来挑战。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）仅通过自然语言提示生成配置文件；2）提供官方文档作为基线，系统评估生成配置的合理性、准确性和一致性。

Result: 研究发现当前LLMs在生成配置时存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLMs在访问控制系统中的部署提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

*Li Changjiang,Liang Jiacheng,Cao Bochuan,Chen Jinghui,Wang Ting*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ReAgent是一种针对LLM代理后门攻击的新型防御方法，通过检测用户指令、代理规划和执行间的不一致性，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级方法：执行层验证代理思维与行动的一致性；规划层通过代理重建指令检查与用户指令的一致性。

Result: ReAgent在多种任务中有效降低攻击成功率，如在数据库操作任务中攻击成功率降低90%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可有效缓解后门风险。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

### [319] [WGLE:Backdoor-free and Multi-bit Black-box Watermarking for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08602)
*Tingzhi Li,Xuefeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WGLE提出了一种新的GNN黑盒水印方法，通过LDDE嵌入多比特字符串作为所有权信息，避免了后门攻击风险，并在实验中表现出高验证准确性和低性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN所有权验证方法（指纹和黑盒水印）存在计算成本高、后门攻击风险或无法传递额外信息的问题，WGLE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: WGLE基于LDDE（层间距离差异）技术，通过预定义边上的正负LDDE值嵌入水印，避免了主任务性能损失。

Result: 在六个数据集和六种GNN架构上，WGLE实现了100%的验证准确率，平均性能损失仅0.85%，且对抗攻击鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: WGLE是一种高效、安全的GNN所有权验证方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.

*Tengfei Lyu,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关意识，显著提升了全球S2S预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S2S预测因大气系统的混沌动力学和多尺度复杂相互作用而具有挑战性，现有方法未能明确建模关键物理过程和遥相关。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer。

Result: TelePiT显著优于现有数据驱动模型和数值天气预报系统，如2米温度RMSE降低57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过整合物理和遥相关建模，为S2S预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度神经网络的变化点检测器在复杂数据模式和常见假设不成立的情况下表现不佳，而标准集成聚合方法（如平均）无法充分利用问题特性。

Method: 引入WWAggr方法，利用Wasserstein距离进行任务特定的集成聚合，适用于多种深度变化点检测模型的集成。

Result: WWAggr方法有效提升了变化点检测的性能，并解决了决策阈值选择的长期问题。

Conclusion: WWAggr是一种高效且通用的集成聚合方法，显著提升了变化点检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Method: 采用基于卷积神经网络的生物医学图像分割架构，可增量训练以适应眼部参数变异，并结合自动红外视频眼动记录系统。

Result: 开发了一种高精度且实用的方法，首次实现了啮齿类动物瞳孔和角膜反射的准确识别。

Conclusion: 该方法结合自动记录系统，为啮齿类动物眼动追踪提供了先进技术，推动了神经科学和视觉科学研究。

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small
size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,
robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection
identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly
accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural
network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye
images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased
eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking
for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for
physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of
complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning
(DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation
with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit
limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and
unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet
effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time
optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and
requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the
versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics
simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力（MHSA）在计算机视觉模型中广泛应用，但其二次复杂度成为计算瓶颈，尤其在实时和资源受限环境中。

Method: 提出PnP-Nystra，一种基于Nyström的线性自注意力近似方法，作为即插即用模块，可直接替换MHSA。

Result: 在图像和视频修复任务中，PnP-Nystra实现了2-4倍（GPU）和2-5倍（CPU）的加速，PSNR损失最大仅1.5 dB。

Conclusion: PnP-Nystra是首个无需训练的线性注意力替代方案，为MHSA提供了高效且性能损失较小的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern
computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input
length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource
constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear
approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that
can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models
without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables
efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures,
including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and
video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution,
demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU
and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the
method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention
functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Result: DCD实现了精确且鲁棒的分割，提升了产前心脏评估的准确性。

Conclusion: DCD模型为胎儿心脏超声图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案，有望减轻超声医师的工作负担。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains
challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and
significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,
biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer
categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular
stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging
clinical settings.

Conclusion: MAMBO在图像生成、超分辨率和异常检测方面表现出潜力，有望提升乳腺X光片分析的准确性和早期病变检测。

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

Motivation: CBCT虽快速低辐射，但存在伪影问题，影响视觉质量，需通过合成CT（sCT）提升。

Method: 结合术中CBCT与术前CT进行多模态学习，使用合成数据集分析对齐和质量对sCT的影响。

Result: 多模态sCT优于单模态基线，尤其在低质量CBCT-CT对齐时效果显著。

Conclusion: 方法在真实临床数据中具有高度可重复性。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中图像因测量过程受到一般仿射变换影响的问题，并进一步研究R-CDT在非仿射变形下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出max-normalized R-CDT和mean-normalized R-CDT，通过控制Wasserstein距离分析其稳定性。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，新特征提取器对局部非仿射变形和脉冲噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: max-normalized和mean-normalized R-CDT在图像分类中表现出良好的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

### [331] [QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675)
*Yuyang Song,Hanxu Yan,Jiale Lao,Yibo Wang,Yufei Li,Yuanchun Zhou,Jianguo Wang,Mingjie Tang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的SQL查询重写系统QUITE，解决了规则方法的三项挑战，并通过多智能体框架和实时反馈显著提升了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规则方法在SQL查询重写中存在局限性，如难以发现新规则、无法泛化到新查询模式等。人类专家能力更强但扩展性差，而LLM具备类似人类的语义和推理能力，因此探索LLM的应用。

Method: 设计了基于有限状态机（FSM）的多智能体框架，结合外部工具和实时数据库反馈；开发了重写中间件优化查询等价生成；采用提示注入技术改进执行计划。

Result: 实验表明，QUITE比现有方法减少查询执行时间达35.8%，重写覆盖率提高24.1%，能处理此前未覆盖的查询案例。

Conclusion: QUITE通过LLM和反馈机制，显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和覆盖范围，超越了传统规则方法。

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个用于评估语言模型在表格数据中处理数据异常能力的基准测试，揭示了前沿模型在数据异常存在时性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的部署日益增多，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、异常值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究，这些异常可能严重影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，构建了包含2980个表格查询对的RADAR基准测试，涵盖9个领域和5种数据异常类型，并系统性地研究表格大小对推理性能的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在无数据异常时表现尚可，但在数据异常存在时性能显著下降，暴露了其在稳健数据分析能力上的不足。

Conclusion: RADAR为提升表格推理能力提供了灵活且可扩展的资源，支持多样化的扰动类型和可控的表格大小。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

TL;DR: SakugaFlow是一个四阶段流程，结合扩散模型和大型语言模型，为新手提供实时反馈，支持非线性修改和多版本分支，将黑盒生成器转化为学习工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI绘图工具虽然能生成高质量图像，但缺乏人类艺术家的分步过程，无法支持学习。

Method: 采用四阶段流程，结合扩散模型和语言模型，提供实时反馈，支持非线性修改和多版本分支。

Result: SakugaFlow通过展示中间输出和嵌入教学对话，支持创意探索和技能学习。

Conclusion: SakugaFlow成功将黑盒生成器转化为支持学习和创作的工具。

Abstract: While current AI illustration tools can generate high-quality images from
text prompts, they rarely reveal the step-by-step procedure that human artists
follow. We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based
image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices
receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any
step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate
outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box
generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative
exploration and skills acquisition.

TL;DR: MOSAIC-F是一个多模态反馈框架，结合了多模态学习分析、观察、传感器、人工智能和协作评估，为学生提供个性化反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结合人类评估和多模态数据，提供更准确、个性化和可操作的反馈。

Method: 框架包括四个步骤：标准化评估、多模态数据收集、AI生成反馈、学生自我评估与可视化。

Result: 在提升口头演讲技能的测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: MOSAIC-F通过结合人类与数据评估，实现了更有效的个性化反馈。

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called
MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and
actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral
presentation skills.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].
