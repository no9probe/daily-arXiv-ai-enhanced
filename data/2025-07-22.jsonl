However, their use as writing assistants in specialized\ndomains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep\ndomain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,\nsuch as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency\nacross multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often\ndegrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge\nrepresentation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on\nfinancial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,\nverifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and\ngenerated content quality."}

In this work, we propose a new\nontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)\nvia geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating\ntextual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other\nlogical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines\nincluding the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of\naxioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,\nindicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real\ncases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT.

Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B\nand 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate\nreproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope\nthese resources will support further research and foster community advancement."}

In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning.

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical\naerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,\nstereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive\nevaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of\nthe UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results\nshow these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very\nsparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with\ncompleteness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose\nestimation.

In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens.

Leveraging the\nrobust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a\nfour-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed\nto effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the\nvisual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising\ncritical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical\nutility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining\nreal-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential\nfor FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial\nautomation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and\nefficient edge recognition is crucial."}

We introduce\nStableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with\nlearnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned\non a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment.

Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets.

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers.

Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person\nvideos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints\ninherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a\ntraining-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.\nEgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR\nfor temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering\n(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and\nremoves redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token\nselector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame\ndiversity.

Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame\ncorrespondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.\nHowever, their performance often suffers from order variations,\nbackground/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which\nutilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a\nstructural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,\noptimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to\ndegenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the\nembedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step.

This study undertook a preliminary\nstep towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription\ndata contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The\nfindings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily\nequate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions.

In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system\ndesigned to efficiently handle comp$\\underline{L}$ex $\\underline{O}$bject\nqueries in large-scale $\\underline{V}$ide$\\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to\nuser queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained\nvisual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build\nan efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding\nboxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector\ndatabase, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO\ntransforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate\nnearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal\nrerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with\ndetailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates\nthat LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with\nnear-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while\nsignificantly reducing index construction costs.

To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep\nlearning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on\nthe CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59\nmonths. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other\ndemographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for\naccurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,\nknown for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and\nfine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a\ncross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of\n0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong\nperformance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge\ndevices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of\ndifferent bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.\nPreliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high\naccuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive\nquantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.\nOverall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and\nhardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,\nand diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications."}

We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in\naerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on\nthe characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,\ncircular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and\nfluid dynamics."}

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method\noutperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF."}

We introduce\nStableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with\nlearnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned\non a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference\nstage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization\nintegrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for\nenhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of\nStableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Although accessible teleoperation plays a\nkey role in inclusive workforce participation, systematic research on its use\nin industrial environments is limited, and few existing studies barely address\nmultimodal guidance designed for BLV users. We present a novel multimodal\nguidance simulator that enables BLV users to control a mobile robot through a\nhigh-fidelity warehouse environment while simultaneously receiving synchronized\nvisual, auditory, and haptic feedback.

We establish its well-posedness\nby proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform\nellipticity condition.

Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and\n24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In\ngeneral, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by\ncompressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence\nlength, and improving model generalization.

However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems.

In particular,\nresearchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative\nAI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the\nfull potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires\naccess to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the\nanalog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not\nonly confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial\nsemiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely\nconfined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused\nprivate datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation\nand impedes progress across the research community. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology\ndiscovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or\ninstitutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this\nvision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique\nchallenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development\nand data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure\nboth flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor\nmanufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset\nsizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized\nbaselines--while maintaining strict data privacy.

To fill this gap, we propose\nSimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five\nrepresentative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86\nAdvanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM\nScalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a\nsystematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18\nrepresentative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful\nfindings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal\ndecrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to\nscalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions\nfor the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation. SimdBench is fully open source at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader\nresearch community."}

Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic\nincentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable\nprotocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first\nempirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,\ndecentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against\nbackdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters\nsynergistic knowledge transfer.

The global model also demonstrates superior\ncross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their\nown specialized data."}

This paper\nexplores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation\nof satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes\nwith classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,\nand generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the\nautonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets.

These results suggest that when data, not\ncompute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to\nthe standard AR paradigm.
