Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)\nmechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of\ninput lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while\nmaintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance\noptimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion\nsteps, significantly improving generation speed.

We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens.

Unbounded\nmaximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these\nRL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns\nout, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the\nLLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various\nscenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically\nresemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring\nhomeostatic targets and \"defaulting\" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It\nis equally concerning that the \"default\" meant also reverting back to\nsingle-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running\nscenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially\nsuccessful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.\nThis means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic\nalignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies\nunder sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or\ncompeting objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover.

Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and\nboundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;\nco-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level\nimpact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative\nintelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data\narchitecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI\ntransformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing\nthe division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their\nconvergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and\nthe future of work."}

This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal\nlogic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world\nreasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the\nlower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a\nSkolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse\nconstants.\n  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational\ncomplexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the\nresults on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and\ntemporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our\nopen-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level\noptimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.\nEmpirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks\ndemonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of\nmagnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.\nAdditionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning\nenvironments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of\nmagnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%\nincrease in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies.

The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an\noversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model\nconsists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with\na filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two\nmodels were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor\npresence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The\nbinary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,\nwhile the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after\noversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass\nmodel faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit\nlimitations.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007\nbits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA\n3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original\n7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.\nFurthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ\nin both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly\nefficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights\non a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes\nand exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.\n  Code - https://github.com/johnnyzheng0636/WGM_bi_quan"}

This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity.

Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections.

Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three\ninnovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time\nalerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while\npreserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the\nhierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.\nEmpirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that\nHyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a\nPR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation\nstudies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic\nembedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,\nwith the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly\ndetection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD\nestablishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money\nlaundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain\nenvironments."}

For more information, please visit our\n  project website: https://strefer.github.io/", "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

We consider a setting in which a subset of edge\ndevices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to\nconduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these\ndevices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and\nincreases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method\nused for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to\nzeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order\noptimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to\ncorrect. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,\nZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.\nZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction\ntechniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource\nclients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp\neliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the\nserver and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the\nup-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various\ndatasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm\nthat can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with\na high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from\ntraining, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of\ndata, thus improving training outcomes."}

This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SY", "stat.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}
