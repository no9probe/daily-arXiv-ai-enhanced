### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new corpus, EvidenceOutcomes, is introduced for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from biomedical literature, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcomes in PICO elements are often neglected or oversimplified, so a robust benchmark is needed.

Method: Developed annotation guidelines with experts, annotated 500 PubMed abstracts, and fine-tuned PubMedBERT for outcome extraction.

Result: High-quality annotations (inter-rater agreement 0.76) and PubMedBERT achieved F1-scores of 0.69 (entity) and 0.76 (token).

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes provides a benchmark for developing ML algorithms to extract outcomes from biomedical texts.

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces retrieval-augmented generation and self-correction mechanisms to improve LLMs' performance in SRL, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative LLMs underperform in SRL compared to encoder-decoder models, prompting the need to enhance their capabilities.

Method: Proposes two mechanisms: retrieval-augmented generation (for external linguistic knowledge) and self-correction (to fix inconsistent outputs).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012 benchmarks in Chinese and English.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and encoder-decoder models in SRL, demonstrating LLMs' potential in this task.

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2AG, a reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation, outperforms baselines by leveraging reinforcement learning and group-based optimization to bridge information gaps and improve clinical note quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle to generate long-form clinical notes from limited patient data, necessitating a solution to enhance retrieval and reasoning.

Method: R2AG uses reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, aided by Group-Based Retriever Optimization (GRO) for better retrieval quality.

Result: R2AG outperforms baselines in clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics, filling semantic gaps and reducing clinical misinterpretation.

Conclusion: R2AG effectively generates long-form discharge instructions by improving retrieval and reasoning, demonstrating its potential for clinical note generation.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASTS improves LTS for LLMs by balancing fluency, diversity, and coherence with dynamic entropy thresholding and multi-objective scoring, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decoding methods like top-k and nucleus sampling fail to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.

Method: ASTS enhances LTS with dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments.

Result: ASTS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks, reducing repetition and improving semantic alignment and fluency.

Conclusion: ASTS is a superior decoding strategy for LLMs, ensuring coherent and diverse text generation efficiently.

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces taz2024full, the largest open-access German newspaper corpus (1.8M articles, 1980-2024), highlighting its utility for bias research, particularly gender representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited large-scale German corpora hinder NLP and CSS research, especially on societal issues like gender bias.

Method: The corpus is analyzed using a scalable pipeline to study gender representation, actor mentions, sentiment, and framing.

Result: Men are consistently overrepresented, but coverage has become more balanced recently.

Conclusion: taz2024full enables diverse research in German NLP and media studies, promoting inclusivity and reproducibility.

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores gender bias in LLMs for e-commerce, identifying unique biases in product descriptions and proposing specialized detection and mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover novel forms of gender bias in LLMs applied to e-commerce, particularly in product description generation, which lacks prior research.

Method: Develops data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias, analyzes GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM, and quantifies bias occurrences.

Result: Reveals unique biases like clothing size assumptions, stereotypical feature advertising, and persuasive language differences, aligning with AI harm frameworks.

Conclusion: Highlights under-explored dimensions of gender bias in e-commerce, contributing to broader AI harm understanding and mitigation.

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TGTalker is a new framework for applying LLMs to dynamic graphs, showing competitive performance in link prediction and offering explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The application of LLMs to real-world dynamic graphs is underexplored, with prior work limited to synthetic data.

Method: TGTalker leverages recency bias and temporal neighbors, converting structural info to natural language for LLMs.

Result: Competitive link prediction performance vs. TGNN models, outperforming TGN and HTGN on five real-world networks.

Conclusion: TGTalker advances temporal graph learning with LLMs, introducing explainability and interpretability in predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

### [8] [Auto Review: Second Stage Error Detection for Highly Accurate Information Extraction from Phone Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05400)
*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Auto Review automates post-call verification in healthcare, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy, and improves transcript quality using ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual verification of noisy call transcripts is labor-intensive and critical for patient care. Automating this process can save time and improve efficiency.

Method: A two-stage system with Auto Review, leveraging multiple ASR alternatives and pseudo-labeling without manual corrections, is proposed.

Result: Experiments show improved transcript quality and efficiency in Auto Review, reducing reliance on manual verification.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enhances accuracy and efficiency in healthcare benefit verification, addressing ASR and jargon challenges.

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [9] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsymKV, a training-free compression framework for KV caches in LLMs, addressing key-value asymmetry to improve long-context modeling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in LLMs limits efficient long-context modeling, and existing KV cache compression methods overlook key-value asymmetry.

Method: Proposes AsymKV, combining homogeneity-based key merging with lossless value compression, leveraging the asymmetry in KV caches.

Result: AsymKV outperforms SOTA methods, achieving 43.95 on LongBench with LLaMA3.1-8B, surpassing H$_2$O (38.89).

Conclusion: AsymKV effectively addresses key-value asymmetry, offering a superior solution for long-context modeling in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency in 4-bit quantization for LLMs by tackling activation outliers, which degrade quantization accuracy.

Method: Integrates channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations to transform outliers into quantization-friendly activations.

Result: Reduces performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by 10-30% in language generation and zero-shot tasks, with no added latency.

Conclusion: SmoothRot effectively improves 4-bit quantization accuracy in LLMs, demonstrating practical benefits without compromising speed.

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores predicting amusing Wordle games using Reddit reactions, GPT-3.5 for classification, and game features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally predict which Wordle games users find amusing by analyzing Reddit reactions and game features.

Method: Scraped 80k Reddit reactions, classified amusement using GPT-3.5, and extracted predictive game features.

Result: Features weakly predict amusement, showing measurable creativity in Wordle games.

Conclusion: User amusement in Wordle games is predictable, revealing aspects of humor-infused creativity.

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

### [12] [MLLM-CL: Continual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05453)
*Hongbo Zhao,Fei Zhu,Rundong Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CL benchmark addresses continual learning challenges in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), introducing domain and ability CL with parameter isolation and routing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with dynamic real-world scenarios requiring continuous knowledge integration, and existing CL benchmarks/methods are limited.

Method: Proposes parameter isolation to prevent catastrophic interference and an MLLM-based routing mechanism.

Result: Achieves minimal forgetting while integrating domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MLLM-CL effectively addresses continual learning challenges in MLLMs, offering a robust solution for dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

### [13] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze language development in children with and without SLI, revealing distinct clusters and challenging traditional diagnostic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early identification of SLI by uncovering natural language development trajectories beyond standardized assessments.

Method: Analyzed narrative samples from 1,163 children using PCA and clustering on 64 linguistic features.

Result: Identified two clusters: high production/low SLI and limited production/high syntactic complexity/high SLI, supporting a continuum model.

Conclusion: SLI is linked to reduced production capacity, not syntactic deficits, advocating for unsupervised learning in diagnostics.

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

### [14] [Improving LLMs with a knowledge from databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05560)
*Petr Máša*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using enhanced association rules to improve LLM answers via RAG, showing significant improvement over ChatGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of control and safety in LLM-generated commands while improving accuracy for dataset-based questions.

Method: Generates rulesets from knowledge patterns, converts rules to text, and integrates them into LLM via RAG.

Result: Significant improvement in answering dataset-based questions compared to ChatGPT.

Conclusion: The method is promising and can be further enhanced with additional patterns or rule mining as an agent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Arab region's unique vulnerabilities (geopolitical, linguistic, cultural) necessitate tailored approaches to combat misinformation.

Method: The study explores strategies like grassroots fact-checking, cultural understanding, social correction, and collaborative networks.

Result: The proposed methods highlight opportunities for a stronger information ecosystem in the Arab world.

Conclusion: Effective misinformation combat in the Arab region requires cultural and community-focused strategies.

Abstract: Misinformation and disinformation pose significant risks globally, with the
Arab region facing unique vulnerabilities due to geopolitical instabilities,
linguistic diversity, and cultural nuances. We explore these challenges through
the key facets of combating misinformation: detection, tracking, mitigation and
community-engagement. We shed light on how connecting with grass-roots
fact-checking organizations, understanding cultural norms, promoting social
correction, and creating strong collaborative information networks can create
opportunities for a more resilient information ecosystem in the Arab world.

### [16] [UTSA-NLP at ArchEHR-QA 2025: Improving EHR Question Answering via Self-Consistency Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05589)
*Sara Shields-Menard,Zach Reimers,Joshua Gardner,David Perry,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for answering clinical questions using EHRs, leveraging large language models in two steps: sentence relevance classification and response generation. Few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding improve accuracy. A smaller 8B model outperforms a larger 70B model in sentence selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of answering clinical questions using EHRs by enhancing sentence relevance classification and response generation.

Method: Uses large language models in two steps: sentence relevance classification (with few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding) and response generation. Compares performance of 8B and 70B models.

Result: The smaller 8B model performs better for sentence selection. Accurate sentence selection is critical for high-quality responses, and self-consistency with thresholding improves reliability.

Conclusion: Effective sentence selection is key for generating reliable responses, and smaller models can outperform larger ones in this task when combined with techniques like self-consistency and thresholding.

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

*Michael J Ryan,Omar Shaikh,Aditri Bhagirath,Daniel Frees,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthesizeMe improves personalized LLM alignment by generating synthetic user personas from interactions, boosting accuracy by 4.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reliance on additional identity info in personalized reward models by leveraging user interactions.

Method: Generates and verifies reasoning for user preferences, induces synthetic personas, and filters interactions for personalized prompts.

Result: 4.4% accuracy improvement in LLM-as-a-judge tasks and top performance on PersonalRewardBench.

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe effectively personalizes LLMs without needing extra identity data.

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPERA, a dataset capturing user personas, actions, and rationales during online shopping, to evaluate LLMs' ability to simulate user behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of high-quality datasets to assess LLMs' capability in mimicking real user behaviors, especially with internal reasoning.

Method: OPERA was collected using an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin, capturing personas, observations, actions, and rationales.

Result: OPERA provides the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in predicting user actions and rationales.

Conclusion: OPERA enables future research into LLM agents as personalized digital twins for humans.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

*Zhecheng Sheng,Xiruo Ding,Brian Hur,Changye Li,Trevor Cohen,Serguei Pakhomov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores gender confounding in dementia detection using transformer models, proposing two methods to mitigate bias, with results showing reduced overfitting but slightly lower detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked impact of speaker gender in dementia detection models, which may lead to biased results.

Method: Proposes the Extended Confounding Filter and Dual Filter to isolate and ablate gender-related weights in transformer models.

Result: Transformer models overfit to training data; disrupting gender-related weights reduces bias but slightly lowers dementia detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Gender confounding in dementia detection can be mitigated, though with a trade-off in performance.

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ID-SPAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using soft prompting with input-dependent self-attention, improving performance and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models is costly; soft prompting offers a parameter-efficient alternative.

Method: ID-SPAM generates soft prompts based on input tokens and uses self-attention to vary token importance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances zero-shot domain transfer.

Conclusion: ID-SPAM is a simple, efficient solution for domain-specific fine-tuning with broad applicability.

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream
tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent
Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

TL;DR: General-purpose LLMs struggle with detecting/extremist cryptolects, but domain adaptation and specialized prompting improve performance. Datasets of 19.4M posts are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of language technologies in detecting and interpreting extremist cryptolects for automated moderation.

Method: Evaluated eight models across six tasks on cryptolects from two extremist platforms.

Result: General-purpose LLMs performed poorly, but domain adaptation and specialized prompting enhanced results.

Conclusion: Findings guide automated moderation tech development; datasets released for further research.

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two
online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our
results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode
extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by
domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and
lexicons validated by human experts.

*John Kirchenbauer,Janny Mongkolsupawan,Yuxin Wen,Tom Goldstein,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset to study how language models memorize facts versus verbatim sequences, using fictional events and QA pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how language models memorize facts and verbatim sequences from training data, which is currently less understood.

Method: Proposes a synthetic dataset of webtext-like documents about fictional events and QA pairs, conducting training experiments to analyze memorization.

Result: Shows synthetic data can effectively distinguish between fact and verbatim memorization, while highlighting challenges in creating realistic fictional data.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset aids in studying memorization processes, though creating realistic fictional data remains challenging.

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

*Priyanka Dey,Yugal Khanter,Aayush Bothra,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' culturally appropriate personality expression, showing improved alignment with human norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked interplay between culture and personality in LLMs, ensuring culturally grounded personality expression.

Method: Introduces CulturalPersonas, a dataset with 3,000 scenario-based questions across six countries, evaluated using multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

Result: Reduces Wasserstein distance by over 20%, improving alignment with human personality distributions and eliciting culturally coherent outputs.

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas enhances LLMs' global adaptability and social intelligence by integrating cultural nuance into personality expression.

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

*Zefan Zeng,Xingchen Hu,Qing Cheng,Weiping Ding,Wentao Li,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEFA is a zero-shot framework for Event Causality Identification (ECI) using Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation to reduce causal hallucination and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECI models rely on supervised methods needing large annotated data, while LLMs suffer from causal hallucination. MEFA addresses these issues.

Method: Decomposes causality into tasks, uses prompts for LLM responses, and aggregates evidence via fuzzy logic for scoring.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 6.2% F1 and 9.3% precision, reducing hallucination errors.

Conclusion: MEFA's task decomposition and fuzzy aggregation effectively improve ECI performance.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified representation for Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency Grammar (DG), and Categorial Grammar (CG), using a correspondence principle to integrate their principles. It demonstrates this with a Turkish discontinuous clause example and shows computational complexity benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the representational principles of PSG, DG, and CG for syntactic and computational simplicity, addressing discontinuity in natural language.

Method: Proposes a correspondence principle and illustrates its application with a Turkish discontinuous subordinate clause, integrating PSG, DG, and CG tenets.

Result: Achieves a unified representation simplifying computational complexity for both continuous and discontinuous sentences, with implications for syntactic analysis.

Conclusion: The unified approach integrates PSG, DG, and CG, offering theoretical and computational advantages for syntactic analysis and language processing.

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Bench is introduced to evaluate GraphRAG's effectiveness in hierarchical knowledge retrieval and contextual reasoning, comparing it to vanilla RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show GraphRAG underperforming vanilla RAG, prompting the need to identify scenarios where graph structures benefit RAG systems.

Method: GraphRAG-Bench includes tasks of varying difficulty (fact retrieval, reasoning, summarization, generation) and evaluates the entire pipeline from graph construction to generation.

Result: The benchmark systematically identifies conditions where GraphRAG outperforms traditional RAG, providing practical guidelines.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench offers a tool to assess GraphRAG's effectiveness, with resources available for community use.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

### [27] [Being Strong Progressively! Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05695)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces POCL, a curriculum learning framework for Knowledge Distillation (KD) in LLMs, addressing distribution shifts and improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for LLMs suffer from issues like catastrophic forgetting and training-inference mismatch due to distribution shifts.

Method: POCL uses a difficulty measurer to rank samples and a training scheduler to introduce them progressively, with rising loss temperatures.

Result: POCL improves student model performance across various KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: Sorted training samples enhance KD stability and performance, demonstrating the value of structured training data in LLM distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

TL;DR: Rel-LLM introduces a GNN-based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs, preserving database structure and improving performance in relational deep learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based serialization methods for LLMs in relational deep learning ignore critical relational structures and face context length limitations.

Method: Rel-LLM uses a GNN encoder to extract local subgraphs, creating structured prompts for LLMs within a RAG framework, preserving relational data.

Result: Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on RDL tasks, offering scalable and efficient integration of LLMs with structured data.

Conclusion: Rel-LLM provides a novel, effective approach for leveraging LLMs in relational deep learning by preserving and utilizing relational structures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework for LLMs, addressing implicit dependencies and non-deterministic knowledge retention, using knowledge graphs and LLM judges for accurate assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods focus on explicit fact removal, neglecting latent dependencies and non-deterministic knowledge, leading to incomplete unlearning.

Method: Proposes a framework with knowledge graphs and confidence scores, using LLM judges to evaluate unlearning success via inference-based protocols.

Result: Experiments show the framework provides realistic unlearning assessment, revealing current strategies overestimate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework offers a rigorous evaluation of unlearning, highlighting gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompting methods for LLMs struggle with temporal tabular QA due to memorization, table size sensitivity, and poor performance on complex queries.

Method: Uses a synthetic dataset (TempTabQA-C) and symbolic intermediate representation (tables to database schemas) with adaptive few-shot prompting for SQL query execution.

Result: Achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance, setting a new benchmark for temporal reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: The structured approach enhances generalization and mitigates biases, improving LLMs' temporal tabular QA capabilities.

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with

TL;DR: Writing-RL, an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework, enhances long-form writing by addressing SFT limitations like data saturation and bounded learning. It uses data selection, pairwise rewards, and dynamic reference scheduling to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT approaches for LLMs have limitations like data saturation and restricted learning capacity, prompting the need for a more advanced framework.

Method: Writing-RL includes Margin-aware Data Selection, Pairwise Comparison Reward, and Dynamic Reference Scheduling to adaptively improve long-form writing.

Result: Experiments show Writing-RL significantly outperforms SFT baselines in long-form writing and generalizes well to long-input reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Writing-RL offers a promising approach for advancing long-form writing and rethinking long-context training in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioMol-MQA, a multimodal QA dataset for polypharmacy, highlighting the need for RAG frameworks to handle diverse data modalities like text and molecular structures in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG-based LLMs primarily retrieve single-modality (text) data, but real-world problems like healthcare require handling multiple modalities (e.g., knowledge graphs, clinical notes, molecular structures).

Method: The authors create BioMol-MQA, a dataset with a multimodal KG (text and molecular structure) and challenging QA tasks to test LLMs' retrieval and reasoning over multimodal data.

Result: Benchmarks show LLMs struggle with the dataset, performing well only when provided with relevant background data, emphasizing the need for robust RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of developing RAG frameworks capable of retrieving and synthesizing multimodal domain-specific information for accurate responses.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over

struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary

Conclusion: dots.llm1 demonstrates efficient scaling of language models via MoE, offering cost-effective performance and open research insights.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters
for each input token. In this report, we present dots.llm1, a large-scale MoE
model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters,
delivering performance on par with state-of-the-art models while reducing
training and inference costs. Leveraging our meticulously crafted and efficient
data processing pipeline, dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to
Qwen2.5-72B after pretraining on 11.2T high-quality tokens and post-training to
fully unlock its capabilities. Notably, no synthetic data is used during
pretraining. To foster further research, we open-source intermediate training
checkpoints at every one trillion tokens, providing valuable insights into the
learning dynamics of large language models.

*Minghan Wang,Ye Bai,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show some awareness of time passage, adapting behavior based on token counts and time pressure, though this varies by model size and reasoning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can perceive and adapt to the passage of time, bridging linguistic tokens and physical time.

Method: Three experiments: validating the Token-Time Hypothesis, testing response adaptation under urgency, and examining behavior in time-pressured navigation (BombRush).

Result: LLMs demonstrate time awareness, adapting response length and behavior under time pressure, but capabilities vary by model.

Conclusion: LLMs can perceive time passage, offering potential for enhancing temporal awareness in time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

*Ye Bai,Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPLE is a multi-agent framework for table-based QA, mimicking human problem-solving with adaptive planning and long-term memory, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning in table-based QA, lacking error detection and experience reuse, unlike human problem-solving.

Method: MAPLE uses 4 components: Solver (ReAct reasoning), Checker (answer verification), Reflector (error diagnosis), and Archiver (long-term memory).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WiKiTQ and TabFact datasets across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MAPLE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by emulating human-like problem-solving with adaptive planning and memory.

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinanceReasoning is a benchmark for evaluating large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical reasoning, offering credibility, comprehensiveness, and challenge improvements over existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of credible, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks for evaluating LRMs in financial reasoning tasks.

Method: Updated and annotated questions from public datasets, constructed Python-formatted functions, and introduced Hard problems requiring multiple financial formulas.

Result: Improved LRM performance (e.g., GPT-4o accuracy rose from 83.2% to 91.6%). Combining Reasoner and Programmer models further enhanced results (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 improved from 83.2% to 87.8%).

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning advances the evaluation and improvement of LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

*Cheonbok Park,Jeonghoon Kim,Joosung Lee,Sanghwan Bae,Jaegul Choo,Kangmin Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Cross-lingual Collapse' in multilingual language models, where reasoning reverts to the dominant pre-training language. Fine-tuning with GRPO reveals language imbalances and irreversible drift, highlighting unequal reasoning capabilities across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) and address the drift of reasoning chains to dominant pre-training languages.

Method: Fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated datasets (GSM8K and SimpleRL-Zoo) in Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian, monitoring task accuracy and language consistency.

Result: GRPO amplifies language imbalances, eroding low-resource languages quickly. Language consistency reward mitigates drift but reduces accuracy by 5-10 pp. The collapse is irreversible.

Conclusion: Not all languages are equally trained for reasoning, emphasizing the impact of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors.

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

*Chenyang Shao,Xinyang Liu,Yutang Lin,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2-Reasoner is a framework for collaborative reasoning across LLMs and SLMs, dynamically routing subtasks based on complexity to reduce costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step reasoning improves LLMs but is costly. Hybrid approaches using SLMs for simpler tasks can optimize efficiency, but require accurate task decomposition and allocation.

Method: R2-Reasoner uses a Reinforced Model Router (task decomposer and subtask allocator) trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reduces API costs by 86.85% while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner enables cost-effective, adaptive LLM reasoning, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MisMitiFact is an efficient framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses to misinformation using lightweight critique models, outperforming LLM self-feedback in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fact-checking is costly and lacks scalability; LLMs can automate counter-response generation but suffer from hallucination.

Method: MisMitiFact uses fine-grained critique models trained on fact-checking data to refine LLM outputs, ensuring factual grounding.

Result: MisMitiFact matches LLM self-feedback quality while achieving ~5x higher throughput with smaller models.

Conclusion: MisMitiFact is a scalable, cost-effective solution for misinformation mitigation, with publicly available code and templates.

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) method to address issues in homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures, enhancing performance and parameter efficiency in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance, limiting LLM potential.

Method: Introduces MoA with two variants: Soft MoA (weighted fusion of expert outputs) and Sparse MoA (sparse expert activation).

Result: Heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous methods in performance and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: MoA effectively leverages diverse adapter structures to improve knowledge transfer in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' inability to dynamically adjust reasoning depth for varying task complexities, leading to inefficiency or suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a tri-mode thinking system, Thinking Density metric, and a Mind Router for optimal mode selection.

Result: Superior zero-shot QA performance and balanced computational efficiency across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynamicMind effectively enhances LLM adaptability and efficiency in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntentionESC and ICECoT to improve emotional support conversations by clarifying supporter intentions and enhancing LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear intentions in emotional support can lead to inappropriate strategies, so defining intentions and improving LLM reasoning is crucial.

Method: Proposes IntentionESC framework and ICECoT mechanism, uses automated annotation for training, and evaluates with a comprehensive scheme.

Result: Validates the framework through experiments, showing improved emotional support responses.

Conclusion: The IntentionESC and ICECoT framework effectively enhances emotional support by clarifying intentions and improving LLM reasoning.

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

TL;DR: A system using LLMs to generate Math Word Problems (MWPs) without additional inputs, improving efficiency but struggling with grade and type adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the time-consuming manual creation of MWPs and limitations of existing Deep Learning techniques requiring extra inputs.

Method: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with inputs like number of MWPs, grade, and question type, experimenting with various LLMs, prompting strategies, and human feedback.

Result: Generated MWPs are high quality with minimal language errors but struggle to meet grade and type specifications.

Conclusion: LLMs offer efficient MWP generation but need improvement in adhering to specific educational requirements.

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new inference-time method, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, improves Theory of Mind (ToM) in LLMs by specifying outputs with a contextual prompt, enhancing performance across diverse scenarios without degrading generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM methods for LLMs are limited to specific contexts with world-state changes, lacking broader applicability.

Method: SoO prefixing involves starting LLM outputs with "Let's put ourselves in A's shoes," where A is the target character, to improve ToM without fine-tuning.

Result: SoO prefixing consistently enhances ToM performance across five mental state categories in conversational and narrative benchmarks.

Conclusion: SoO prefixing is a simple, effective method for improving ToM in LLMs, applicable to broader contexts and eliciting faithful reasoning.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Motivation: Text anonymization lacks a universal benchmark for evaluating privacy and utility trade-offs.

Method: Developed Tau-Eval, a Python-based framework, to assess anonymization techniques.

Result: Provides a tool for evaluating anonymization methods with public code and tutorials.

Conclusion: Tau-Eval addresses the gap in benchmarking anonymization, aiding privacy-utility balance.

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

### [50] [A Culturally-Rich Romanian NLP Dataset from "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05991)
*Alexandru-Gabriel Ganea,Antonia-Adelina Popovici,Adrian-Marius Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform better on international questions than culturally specific ones, as shown by testing on a Romanian game show dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM performance across languages and cultural contexts, highlighting the need for culturally-aware NLP systems.

Method: Created a multilingual dataset from a Romanian game show using OCR, text extraction, and manual verification. Benchmarking LLMs on this dataset.

Result: LLMs scored 80-95% on international questions but only 50-75% on Romanian-specific ones, showing cultural context impacts performance.

Conclusion: Cultural context and data source significantly affect LLM performance, emphasizing the need for robust, culturally-aware NLP systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

### [51] [Token Signature: Predicting Chain-of-Thought Gains with Token Decoding Feature in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06008)
*Peijie Liu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the correlation between token probability monotonicity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning effectiveness, proposing Dynamic CoT to dynamically choose between CoT and direct answers, reducing token use by 35% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand inconsistent CoT performance gains and improve efficiency by leveraging token probability distributions.

Method: Proposes two indicators based on token probability distributions, combines them with logistic regression for Dynamic CoT, and extends it to closed-source models.

Result: Indicators achieve 89.2% accuracy in assessing CoT effectiveness; Dynamic CoT reduces token use by over 35% with high accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides insights into CoT mechanisms and a framework for efficient deployment, balancing performance and resource use.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

*Haoke Zhang,Xiaobo Liang,Cunxiang Wang,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AvR (Alignment via Refinement) enhances LLM recursive reasoning by integrating criticism and improvement actions, outperforming traditional methods with a 20% win rate boost on AlpacaEval 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack recursive thinking capabilities without expert-curated data, limiting their potential for long-form Chain of Thought reasoning.

Method: AvR uses a refinement process with differentiable learning to optimize refinement-aware rewards, organizing multi-round data into long refinement thoughts.

Result: AvR significantly outperforms preference optimization methods, improving LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct's win rate by over 20% with just 3k synthetic samples.

Conclusion: AvR effectively unlocks LLM potential for recursive reasoning, demonstrating scalability and superior performance with minimal data.

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

*Yu Li,Lehui Li,Zhihao Wu,Qingmin Liao,Jianye Hao,Kun Shao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for improving LLM agent design by combining hierarchical search, predictive modeling, and MCTS, achieving 8.34% better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent search methods are inefficient, costly, and underutilize human-designed components.

Method: Hierarchical search space, predictive value model, and uncertainty-informed MCTS.

Result: 8.34% average performance gain over baselines with faster search progress.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations in agent design, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

TL;DR: SR-DCR is a lightweight framework using self-confidence and multi-agent debate to resolve conflicts between parametric knowledge and contextual input, improving reliability without heavy computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address factual inconsistencies or hallucinations in large language models when parametric knowledge clashes with contextual input.

Method: Integrates token-level self-confidence with asymmetric multi-agent debate (critic, defender, judge) to evaluate context reliability. Final answer combines verdict and model confidence.

Result: Outperforms classical debate and confidence-only baselines on ClashEval, enhancing robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SR-DCR effectively balances reliability and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for contextual conflicts in language models.

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FEEDER is a pre-selection framework for in-context learning (ICL) that identifies a representative subset of demonstrations, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods are computationally expensive due to repeated retrieval from large datasets. FEEDER aims to improve efficiency by pre-selecting essential demonstrations.

Method: FEEDER uses "sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics and a tree-based algorithm to pre-select a representative subset of demonstrations. It also employs a bi-level optimization method for fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: Experiments show FEEDER reduces training data size by over 20% while maintaining performance across LLMs with 300M to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: FEEDER efficiently replaces full training data in ICL, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising performance, and integrates well with downstream strategies.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

*Zhitao He,Zongwei Lyu,Dazhong Chen,Dadi Guo,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATP-BENCH, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) in multimodal settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of MLLMs as ATPs in multimodal theorem proving, given their success in solving mathematical problems.

Method: Developed MATP-BENCH, a benchmark with 1056 multimodal theorems from various levels of mathematics, formalized in Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle.

Result: Existing MLLMs solve only a limited number of MATP-BENCH problems, highlighting the challenge.

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH presents an open challenge for advancing research in multimodal automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CatShift is a label-only framework for detecting unauthorized dataset usage in LLMs by leveraging catastrophic forgetting, without needing internal model logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized use of proprietary datasets in LLMs poses legal and financial risks, but existing methods rely on log probabilities, which are often withheld.

Method: CatShift uses catastrophic forgetting: fine-tuning on suspicious data causes output shifts if the data was previously seen, compared to a non-member validation set.

Result: Experiments show CatShift effectively identifies dataset membership in logit-inaccessible settings.

Conclusion: CatShift provides a practical solution for protecting proprietary data in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces extraction attack algorithms for FedLLMs, operating under a realistic threat model, and evaluates their effectiveness in extracting PII, highlighting vulnerabilities and the need for defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks posed by the memorization ability of LLMs in federated fine-tuning, especially in extracting unseen PII from other clients.

Method: Proposes simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms, leveraging contextual prefixes, and evaluates them using coverage rate and efficiency metrics on a real-world legal dataset.

Result: The method extracts up to 56.57% of victim-exclusive PII, with 'Address,' 'Birthday,' and 'Name' being most vulnerable.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the urgent need for robust defense strategies and provide a benchmark for future privacy-preserving federated learning research.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot method (ATC) for detecting LLM-generated code by analyzing token-level entropy under approximated task conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in detecting LLM-generated code for security, IP, and academic integrity.

Method: Uses conditional probability distributions, focusing on task-conditioned token-level entropy without needing the original LLM or prompts.

Result: ATC outperforms benchmarks, generalizing across languages like Python, CPP, and Java.

Conclusion: Task-level conditioning is crucial for detecting LLM-generated code, with ATC offering a practical, effective solution.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIAD introduces a curated corpus of medical QA pairs to improve LLM accuracy and reduce hallucinations in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate inaccurate medical content, and existing RAG pipelines use noisy, unstructured text, lacking systematic organization.

Method: MIRIAD creates 5.8M QA pairs from peer-reviewed literature using LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation.

Result: MIRIAD improves LLM accuracy by 6.7% and hallucination detection by 22.5-37% (F1 score) over unstructured RAG baselines.

Conclusion: MIRIAD enables reliable LLM applications in healthcare through targeted retrieval and interactive exploration.

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

*Atharv Kulkarni,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution-based feedback to improve SQL query generation from natural language, achieving significant accuracy gains without supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SQL generation by leveraging execution feedback instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning with text-code pairs.

Method: Frames the problem as RL, using GRPO and execution-based rewards (penalizing failures, rewarding correct answers). Evaluated on a tabular reasoning benchmark.

Result: RL-tuning improved SQL accuracy from 31.49 to 49.83 and reduced errors from 25.43% to 14.71%, nearly matching SQLCoder-70B's performance.

Conclusion: Execution-based feedback can effectively improve LLMs' symbolic reasoning, offering a viable alternative to supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can capture multiple perspectives in subjective tasks like hate speech detection, but few-shot setups struggle with full human judgment spectrum. Prompt design and demonstration selection impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can reflect human disagreement in subjective NLP tasks, moving beyond aggregated labels.

Method: Uses in-context learning (ICL) in zero-shot and few-shot settings with four open-source LLMs, testing label modeling strategies and demonstration selection methods.

Result: Multi-perspective generation works in zero-shot, but few-shot often fails to capture full human judgment. Prompt design and demonstration selection affect performance.

Conclusion: Modeling subjectivity with LLMs is challenging, emphasizing the need for perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A phonetic correction system improves ASR accuracy for underrepresented movie titles by generating phonetic alternatives and rescoring them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality ASR training data is costly, and recent or infrequent movie titles may suffer poor recognition due to insufficient representation in training data.

Method: Proposes a phonetic correction system with (a) phonetic search for alternatives and (b) a rescorer to combine and select the best output.

Result: Improves word error rate by 4.4-7.6% relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles.

Conclusion: The phonetic correction system effectively enhances ASR performance for underrepresented titles.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Result: NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in conditionals; fine-tuning on existing datasets doesn't improve performance.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of NLI models in conditional reasoning and suggests need for better approaches.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

### [65] [semantic-features: A User-Friendly Tool for Studying Contextual Word Embeddings in Interpretable Semantic Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06169)
*Jwalanthi Ranganathan,Rohan Jha,Kanishka Misra,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'semantic-features,' a library for analyzing contextualized word embeddings in interpretable spaces, and applies it to study the semantic effects of dative constructions in sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how contextualized word embeddings reflect semantic interpretations of ambiguous referents in different dative constructions.

Method: A dataset of 450 sentence pairs (prepositional vs. double object dative) was created, and the 'semantic-features' tool was used to analyze embeddings from three masked language models.

Result: The embeddings showed expected sensitivities, indicating the tool's effectiveness in capturing semantic nuances.

Conclusion: The tool is promising for studying contextualized embeddings and their semantic interpretations.

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

### [66] [Does It Run and Is That Enough? Revisiting Text-to-Chart Generation with a Multi-Agent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06175)
*James Ford,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent pipeline reduces execution errors in chart-generating code from 15% to 4.5%, but issues like hallucinations and accessibility remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if persistent errors in chart-generating code stem from model limitations or single-prompt design.

Method: Propose a lightweight multi-agent pipeline (drafting, execution, repair, judgment) using GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Error rates drop to 4.5% (Text2Chart31) and 4.6% (ChartX), but hallucinations and accessibility issues persist.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and accessibility over execution reliability.

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning Llama3 with VP evaluation criteria in prompts outperforms CoT technique for VP detection, matching GPT-4 performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of VP transcripts and improving small LM performance in VP detection.

Method: Fine-tuning Llama3 with VP criteria, applying CoT, and testing on adversarial datasets.

Result: Llama3-8B with VP criteria in prompts performs best among small LMs, comparable to GPT-4.

Conclusion: Human expert knowledge in prompts is more effective than CoT for small LMs in VP detection.

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

TL;DR: PuzzleWorld is a benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems to test open-ended, multimodal reasoning in models, revealing current limitations and potential improvements through reasoning annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve foundation models' performance in open-ended, creative reasoning tasks, mirroring real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Method: Introduces PuzzleWorld, a benchmark with annotated puzzles, solutions, reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels for holistic evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly (1-14% accuracy), but fine-tuning on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with open-ended reasoning, highlighting the need for better multimodal and iterative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in theoretical physics, identifying gaps and envisioning future applications.

Method: Analyzes current LLM capabilities in physics, focusing on mathematical reasoning and code generation, and identifies gaps.

Result: Identifies critical gaps in LLMs for physics, such as physical intuition and constraint satisfaction, and proposes future directions.

Conclusion: Collaboration between physics and AI communities is needed to develop physics-specialized LLMs and advance scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains,
yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This
position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate
theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with
domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics
-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in

### [71] [Explaining Matters: Leveraging Definitions and Semantic Expansion for Sexism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06238)
*Sahrish Khan,Arshad Jhumka,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting sexism online by proposing two prompt-based data augmentation techniques and an ensemble strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on the EDOS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexism detection in online content is hindered by data sparsity, class imbalance, and nuanced language, necessitating improved methods.

Method: Proposes Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA) and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE) for data enrichment, and an ensemble strategy for reliable classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EDOS dataset, with macro F1 improvements of 1.5 points for binary classification and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively address data and classification challenges, advancing sexism detection in online content.

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG improves RAG by resolving conflicts between external and parametric knowledge in LLMs using mixed-attention and unsupervised hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with knowledge conflicts and lack mechanisms to resolve them, degrading performance.

Method: Proposes DSSP-RAG with mixed-attention for shared-private semantics, unsupervised hallucination detection, and EQ-based noise reduction.

Result: Outperforms baselines by resolving conflicts and enhancing dual-stream knowledge complementarity.

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG effectively integrates and refines knowledge, improving RAG performance and stability.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

*Sabri Eyuboglu,Ryan Ehrlich,Simran Arora,Neel Guha,Dylan Zinsley,Emily Liu,Will Tennien,Atri Rudra,James Zou,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher Re*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Cartridges,' a method to train smaller KV caches offline for large text corpora, reducing memory and cost compared to in-context learning (ICL). Self-study, a synthetic conversation-based training approach, matches ICL performance while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models are costly to serve due to high memory consumption from KV caches when handling long contexts. The goal is to reduce this cost while maintaining performance.

Method: Train a smaller KV cache (Cartridge) offline using self-study, a method involving synthetic conversations and context-distillation, instead of naive next-token prediction.

Result: Cartridges with self-study match ICL performance, reduce memory usage by 38.6x, increase throughput by 26.4x, and extend effective context length.

Conclusion: Self-study-trained Cartridges offer a cost-effective, high-performance alternative to ICL, with added benefits like context extension and composability.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm is a framework to reduce bias in LLM-based text summarization using adversarial training, improving fairness without losing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit biases from pre-training data, leading to unfair outputs in summarization tasks.

Method: AdvSumm uses a Perturber component to apply gradient-guided perturbations at embedding levels, enhancing robustness.

Result: AdvSumm reduces name-nationality and political framing biases better than standard transformers and data augmentation.

Conclusion: AdvSumm effectively mitigates bias in summarization while maintaining performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: GPT-4V shows strong zero-shot performance (85% accuracy) in detecting image splicing, with CoT prompting being most effective. It leverages both visual artifacts and contextual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GPT-4V's capabilities in image forensics, specifically detecting image splicing, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4V using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting on a subset of the CASIA v2.0 dataset.

Result: Achieved competitive accuracy (85%) in zero-shot settings, with CoT providing balanced performance. The model uses visual and contextual cues.

Conclusion: GPT-4V is a flexible tool for image forensics due to its generalizability and interpretability, though it lags behind specialized models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: CO₂ emissions are critical for environmental and industrial monitoring, especially in livestock management. The need for accurate, real-time detection tools drives this work.

Method: Integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components. Introduces two datasets: CCR (controlled leaks) and RTA (livestock emissions).

Result: Achieves 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with 60.95 FPS. CarboFormer, a lightweight variant, offers 84.68 FPS and competitive performance.

Conclusion: CarboNeXT and CarboFormer provide robust, real-time CO₂ emission analysis tools, advancing environmental sensing and precision livestock management.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

TL;DR: STFlow, a flow matching generative model, improves spatial transcriptomics (ST) prediction by modeling cell-cell interactions and addressing memory constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ST prediction methods lack explicit modeling of cell-cell interactions and face memory issues due to large datasets.

Method: STFlow uses a flow matching generative model to jointly model gene expression across slides and employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention.

Result: STFlow achieves over 18% relative improvement on benchmarks HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: STFlow effectively addresses limitations of prior ST prediction methods, offering better performance and scalability.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A seed selection method is proposed to improve image quality in diffusion-based scalable image coding without extra bitrate by selecting the optimal seed from multiple candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. The goal is to enhance quality without increasing bitrate.

Method: Proposes selecting the optimal seed from multiple candidates, using intermediate outputs from early steps of the reverse diffusion process to reduce computational cost.

Result: Outperforms the baseline across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The seed selection method effectively improves image quality without additional bitrate, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based method for generating stereo images from text prompts, leveraging Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning for improved stereo consistency and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, making training a diffusion model from scratch impractical.

Method: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on stereo datasets, enhance with prompt alignment and stereo consistency rewards.

Result: Generates high-quality stereo images, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts diffusion models for stereo image generation with superior results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Highlights the intersection of generative AI, art history, and education, while addressing ethical concerns like deepfakes and biases.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: True system states are often unavailable, complicating policy learning in dynamic systems.

Method: Integrates CNNs for spatial features and GRUs for temporal modeling, training a DQN agent with learned states.

Result: Enables real-time, accurate state estimation and control without ground-truth access.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel approach for state representation and control, validated by quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic

Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of counterfeit images/videos online, proposing a GAN-based detection method using a discriminant network (InceptionResNetV2) and a user platform for forgery detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of manipulated media (images/videos) spreads misinformation and hides crimes, necessitating advanced detection methods.

Method: Uses a convolutional neural network (InceptionResNetV2) as a discriminant network to identify GAN-generated content and proposes a user platform for detection.

Result: The discriminant network effectively detects GAN-generated counterfeit images/videos, aiding forensic analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method and platform can assist in identifying criminal activities by detecting forged media, contributing to forensic efforts.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Result: Identifies potential solutions for UAV autonomy through computer vision, enabling applications in diverse fields.

Conclusion: Computer vision can significantly improve UAV autonomy, addressing current limitations and expanding their utility in critical areas.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet for fair biometric face authentication across demographics, testing pre-trained models and a novel few-shot prototype network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness and generalization challenges in biometric face authentication across diverse demographic groups.

Method: Combined ViT and ResNet features, trained on custom datasets, and tested with a few-shot prototype network on demographic-specific datasets.

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer outperformed other ViT models; performance improved with larger support sets.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for fair biometric authentication, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified two-stage training framework for MLLMs to jointly optimize visual quality scoring and reasoning, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat quality scoring and reasoning as separate tasks, causing a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.

Method: A two-stage framework: cold-start with teacher model distillation, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning using GRPO.

Result: Q-Ponder achieves 6.5% higher SRCC on benchmarks and outperforms SOTA models in description accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified framework enhances both scoring accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating generalization potential.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS is a tri-modal framework for keyframe extraction, combining color, structural, and semantic cues via PCA and HDBSCAN, achieving state-of-the-art performance on TVSum20 and SumMe datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient keyframe extraction is challenging due to the complexity of video content. Integrating multiple modalities can better capture its richness.

Method: TriPSS fuses CIELAB color features, ResNet-50 embeddings, and Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct captions via PCA, then clusters with HDBSCAN and refines the output.

Result: TriPSS outperforms traditional unimodal and prior multi-modal methods on TVSum20 and SumMe datasets.

Conclusion: TriPSS sets a new benchmark for video content understanding by effectively capturing nuanced visual and semantic information.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2SAM improves segmentation of complex objects by integrating textual guidance with SAM-HQ, achieving better accuracy and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, limiting their effectiveness for complex objects.

Method: Talk2SAM uses CLIP-based embeddings from text prompts, projected into DINO feature space, to guide SAM-HQ for better segmentation.

Result: Outperforms SAM-HQ by up to +5.9% IoU and +8.3% boundary IoU on benchmarks like BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.

Conclusion: Natural language guidance enhances segmentation precision, especially where traditional methods fail, offering flexibility and control.

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency and computational overhead in VLMs hinder real-time autonomous driving applications, especially due to over-inference.

Method: Proposes AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that uses domain characteristics and causal inference to identify optimal exit layers.

Result: Evaluated on Waymo, CODA, and Autoware Universe, AD-EE reduces latency (up to 57.58%) and improves accuracy (up to 44%).

Conclusion: AD-EE effectively addresses inefficiencies in VLMs for autonomous driving, enhancing real-time performance and accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual anomaly detection is crucial for stability and safety in robot scientific laboratories.

Method: Proposes a VLM-based approach with four progressively informative prompt configurations and constructs a tailored visual benchmark.

Result: Detection accuracy improves with contextual information; real-world validations confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: Provides a data-driven foundation and evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific workflows.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify

*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS shifts self-distillation from whole images to individual objects, improving visual representations by focusing on object-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining assumes single-object images, limiting scalability to complex, scene-centric datasets.

Method: Uses object-aware cropping and masked attention to isolate objects, simplifying tasks.

Result: Achieves 82.6% k-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Conclusion: ODIS enhances pretraining by focusing on object-level granularity, improving performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: Most Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform poorly at gaze-referential inference, unlike humans who excel. Top-tier VLMs show some capability, relying on heuristics and guessing, but struggle with task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' ability to infer gaze direction, a key aspect of human-AI interaction, and compare it to human performance.

Method: Evaluated 111 VLMs and 65 humans using manipulated photos, analyzing performance with mixed-effects models.

Result: 94 VLMs failed to outperform random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. Top-tier VLMs showed limited but non-random performance.

Conclusion: VLMs lack robust gaze inference, hindering natural human-AI interaction, but potential exists for improvement.

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV-LLMs and benchmarks lack focus on 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments.

Method: SAVVY uses a two-stage pipeline: Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation and Dynamic Global Map Construction.

Result: SAVVY improves state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench and SAVVY advance the field by addressing dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an HDF5-based alternative to STEP format for CAD B-rep data, enabling easier integration into learning pipelines without costly licenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEP format requires CAD kernels, limiting usage in large learning pipelines due to licensing costs.

Method: Developed an open HDF5 format, a Python library for processing, and converted datasets (Fusion 360, ABC) for validation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness via four use cases (normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, segmentation), ensuring data integrity.

Conclusion: The HDF5 format and tools provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for CAD data in machine learning.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an

standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360

estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

*Chi Xie,Fangao Zeng,Yue Hu,Shuang Liang,Yichen Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel category query learning approach for human-object interaction (HOI) classification, achieving state-of-the-art results by leveraging transformer decoders and auxiliary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement existing HOI methods by introducing category query learning, inspired by multi-label image classification, for improved interaction classification.

Method: Proposes category query learning, where queries linked to interaction categories are transformed via a transformer decoder and trained with an auxiliary image-level classification task.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks when integrated with three HOI baselines.

Conclusion: The method is simple, general, and effective, demonstrating the potential of category query learning in HOI tasks.

Abstract: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object
features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query
learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories,
converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,
and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is
motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the
first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification
task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three
representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPD method improves vision-based RL by extracting task-relevant features from images with distractions, using weak and strong augmentations to predict transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., shadows, clouds) in vision-based RL, especially when unseen during training.

Method: Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) uses weak and strong augmentations to predict inverse and forward transitions between augmented versions of observations.

Result: SPD outperforms prior methods in MuJoCo visual control tasks and CARLA driving, enhancing generalization for unseen observations.

Conclusion: SPD effectively extracts task-relevant features, improving robustness and performance in vision-based RL with distractions.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

TL;DR: Dr. G is a self-supervised MBRL method using dual contrastive learning and a recurrent state inverse dynamics model to improve robustness against visual distractions, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of MBRL algorithms in handling visual distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows) in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Dr. G with dual contrastive learning for task-relevant feature capture and a recurrent state inverse dynamics model for temporal understanding.

Result: Dr. G improves performance by 117% and 14% over prior works in tested environments.

Conclusion: Dr. G enhances MBRL robustness against visual distractions, demonstrating strong generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

*Seunghwan Shin,Yusung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient one-stage MPPE model using raw RF signals, outperforming previous methods with improved accuracy and generalization, and proposes a novel SSL method for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RF-based MPPE methods are either computationally intensive or lack accuracy. The paper aims to address these limitations with a lightweight model and better performance.

Method: The model sub-groups RF signals, embeds them with a shared single-layer CNN and multi-head attention, and introduces a self-supervised learning method for masked data prediction.

Result: The model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15% in PCKh@0.5 and shows significant gains in new locations or with obstacles.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, lightweight, and outperforms existing approaches, with open-sourced code and dataset for reproducibility.

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIV-Bench is a video benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in social scene understanding, reasoning, and dynamics prediction, revealing strengths in scene understanding but struggles in reasoning and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of human social interaction complexity for AI by creating a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in social understanding and reasoning.

Method: Developed SIV-Bench with 2,792 video clips and 8,792 QA pairs from TikTok and YouTube, covering diverse genres and cultural contexts, and analyzed MLLMs' performance.

Result: MLLMs excel in Social Scene Understanding (SSU) but struggle with Social State Reasoning (SSR) and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP), with Relation Inference (RI) as a key bottleneck.

Conclusion: SIV-Bench highlights MLLMs' limitations in social reasoning and dynamics, emphasizing the need for improved models and the importance of transcribed dialogue in understanding social interactions.

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A surrogate model is trained to generate adversarial perturbations for vision-language models, outperforming existing multi-modal and single-modality attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to small perturbations, challenging their robustness in deployment.

Method: A surrogate model generates joint representations for coordinated adversarial attacks on both image and text modalities.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms other attacks, compromising state-of-the-art models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT.

Conclusion: The approach effectively evaluates and undermines the robustness of vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for robust video classification evaluation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video classification models are complex and costly to evaluate for robustness. Minimizing perturbations while inducing misclassification is challenging.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) to identify sensitive regions and generate fine perturbations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on Lp metric and average queries, with custom distortion types for relevant evaluation.

Conclusion: The method effectively evaluates robustness of video classification models, demonstrated on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

*Sho Takishita,Jay Gala,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Kentaro Inui,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based VLMs compensate for weak visual features with strong language backbones, enabling performance recovery in reduced visual contextualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if the language backbone in VLMs compensates for limitations in CLIP-based visual encoders.

Method: Controlled self-attention ablations on three CLIP-based VLMs using a probing task.

Result: CLIP visual representations provide semantic info, but the language decoder can compensate for visual deficiencies.

Conclusion: VLMs dynamically balance visual and language processing, suggesting future architectures could leverage more language-based visual processing.

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

*Ludovic Arnould,Salim Khazem,Hugues Ali Mehenni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation method for Visual Language Models (VLMs) using synthetic images to systematically test and analyze perception failures, addressing limitations of current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks are costly, prone to leakage, and lack clarity on failure causes (perception, reasoning, or knowledge).

Method: Procedural generation of synthetic images with controlled variations to isolate and test specific visual perception capabilities.

Result: Enables fine-grained failure analysis and interpretable assessment of VLMs, shifting focus from aggregate accuracy to targeted evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more precise and systematic way to evaluate VLMs, improving understanding of their limitations.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for autonomous driving face issues like redundancy in datasets, high computational costs, and slow inference speeds, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Developed NuScenes-S, a machine-friendly structured dataset, and FastDrive, a compact VLM that processes structured descriptions efficiently.

Result: FastDrive achieves 20% higher accuracy in decision-making tasks and a 10x speedup in inference compared to larger VLMs. Ablation studies highlight the importance of scene annotations.

Conclusion: Structured datasets and compact VLMs like FastDrive can bridge the gap between VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR image segmentation face challenges in convergence and stability due to complex data distributions.

Method: Integration of mode normalization into U-Net and SegNet to enhance performance.

Result: Mode normalization accelerates convergence and increases model stability across different zones.

Conclusion: Normalization effectively boosts computational efficiency and generalization in SAR segmentation.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

TL;DR: A novel framework uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to classify degraded images into four categories and applies targeted restoration for improved visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image degradation affects visual quality and downstream tasks, necessitating an automated solution for classification and restoration.

Method: The VLM classifies images into four degradation types, followed by targeted restoration using specialized models for each type.

Result: The approach effectively classifies degradations and enhances image quality through tailored restoration.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, automated solution for real-world image enhancement by combining VLMs with advanced restoration techniques.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR is a novel method for detecting and localizing image manipulations, especially those made by diffusion models, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of advanced diffusion models has improved image manipulation quality but also increased misuse risks, necessitating reliable detection methods.

Method: RADAR leverages foundation models, combines features from multiple image modalities, and uses an auxiliary contrastive loss to isolate manipulated patches.

Result: RADAR excels in accuracy and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the BBC-PAIR benchmark with 28 diffusion models.

Conclusion: RADAR is a robust solution for detecting image edits, even by unseen diffusion models, with publicly available code, data, and models.

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2GO introduces a query-based 3D representation for occupancy prediction, outperforming dense methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense representations are slow and inflexible for temporal dynamics in driving scenes.

Method: Summarizes scenes into 3D queries, propagated temporally and decoded into semantic Gaussians, with a denoising rendering objective.

Result: Achieves SOTA on nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks, 1.5 IoU higher and 5.9x faster than GaussianWorld.

Conclusion: Query-based representations are efficient and effective for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Motivation: Existing reflection removal methods lack large-scale, diverse datasets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A U-Net-based model is trained on the new dataset, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE metrics.

Result: The dataset and model are validated, showing practical performance improvements in reflection removal.

Conclusion: The dataset and code will be publicly released to advance future research in reflection removal.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the

Motivation: To explore how top-down information influences visual processing and to bridge human cognition with computer vision.

Method: A dual-network model: one for basic tasks, the other for contextual guidance via attention.

Result: The model's attention patterns resembled human spatial and feature-based attention.

Conclusion: Neural networks can effectively model human visual attention, offering insights into cognition.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Ling Ouyang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Huiming Sun,Chiu Man Ho,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR), combining global frequency domain and multi-scale feature extraction to handle complex reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflections in images degrade quality, and existing methods struggle with varied reflection properties like intensity, shape, and size.

Method: Proposes F2T2-HiT, integrating FFT Transformer blocks for global frequency analysis and Hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale feature extraction within a UNet framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The F2T2-HiT architecture effectively addresses SIRR challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: FocusDiff improves fine-grained text-image alignment in autoregressive text-to-image models by focusing on subtle semantic differences between similar prompts, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive text-to-image models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment, as revealed by the PairComp benchmark.

Method: Proposes FocusDiff, leveraging a new dataset of paired texts/images with similar expressions but distinct local semantics, and a reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize fine-grained differences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-image benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Conclusion: FocusDiff effectively addresses fine-grained alignment challenges, enabling precise control over visual tokens.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORSE-500 is a dynamic video benchmark addressing gaps in current multimodal reasoning benchmarks by focusing on temporal complexity, diverse reasoning skills, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack temporal dynamics, narrow focus on math, and saturate quickly, limiting progress measurement and failure diagnosis.

Method: MORSE-500 uses scripted video clips (500 total) generated via Python scripts, generative models, and real footage, enabling controlled complexity and scalability.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps, especially in abstract and planning tasks.

Conclusion: MORSE-500 is designed to evolve and support future research in multimodal reasoning, with released resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YoursProtoP introduces an interactive strategy to personalize prototypical parts in neural networks, improving concept consistency and user alignment without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-based interpretable models suffer from concept inconsistency and lack user feedback mechanisms, misaligning model reasoning with human understanding.

Method: YoursProtoP adapts and splits visual concepts based on user supervision, ensuring personalized and consistent explanations.

Result: Experiments on FunnyBirds, CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets show YoursProtoP maintains accuracy while improving concept consistency.

Conclusion: YoursProtoP effectively bridges the gap between model reasoning and user understanding by incorporating personalized feedback.

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

TL;DR: FRAME is a self-supervised video frame encoder designed for dense video understanding, outperforming image and video models on dense prediction tasks while maintaining temporal and spatial coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image encoders lack temporal awareness, and video models underperform on dense prediction tasks, creating a need for a specialized video encoder.

Method: FRAME predicts current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, ensuring spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. It also aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space for language-driven tasks.

Result: FRAME outperforms image encoders and existing video models across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets.

Conclusion: FRAME is a versatile, compact video encoder that bridges the gap between image and video models for dense video understanding.

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

*Vadim Tschernezki,Diane Larlus,Andrea Vedaldi,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing 2D motion predictions into layered radiance fields, addressing challenges with test-time refinement to outperform 2D baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D techniques often fail for dynamic phenomena, unlike static scenes. The paper aims to enhance 3D dynamic segmentation by leveraging 2D motion cues.

Method: Proposes Layered Motion Fusion (fusing 2D motion segmentation into 3D layered radiance fields) and test-time refinement to handle complex dynamic videos.

Result: The 3D model's segmentation surpasses the 2D baseline significantly, showing 3D techniques can enhance dynamic scene analysis.

Conclusion: 3D methods can improve 2D analysis for dynamic phenomena, even in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

### [120] [When Semantics Mislead Vision: Mitigating Large Multimodal Models Hallucinations in Scene Text Spotting and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05551)
*Yan Shu,Hangui Lin,Yexin Liu,Yan Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Yan Li,Yu Zhou,Ser-Nam Lim,Harry Yang,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic hallucination in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when handling ambiguous or non-semantic scene text. It proposes a training-free framework (ZoomText and Grounded Layer Correction) to mitigate this issue and introduces TextHalu-Bench for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs often produce visually incorrect answers (semantic hallucination) for ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, highlighting a need for improved accuracy.

Method: The framework includes ZoomText (coarse-to-fine text region identification) and Grounded Layer Correction (using internal representations from less hallucination-prone layers).

Result: The method effectively reduces semantic hallucination and performs well on scene text spotting and understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates semantic hallucination in LMMs without additional training, validated by TextHalu-Bench and public benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EX-4D is a novel framework for generating high-quality, camera-controllable videos from monocular input, addressing geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts using a Depth Watertight Mesh representation and simulated masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts under extreme viewpoints, degrading visual quality.

Method: EX-4D uses a Depth Watertight Mesh for geometric consistency, a simulated masking strategy for training data, and a LoRA-based video diffusion adapter for synthesis.

Result: EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in physical consistency and extreme-view quality.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical 4D video generation with improved visual and geometric fidelity.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

*Andreas Meuleman,Ishaan Shah,Alexandre Lanvin,Bernhard Kerbl,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast on-the-fly method for joint camera pose estimation and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) optimization, handling large scenes and wide baselines efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for pose estimation and 3DGS optimization are slow or struggle with wide baselines and large scenes.

Method: Introduces fast initial pose estimation with learned features and GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment, plus direct sampling of Gaussian primitives for incremental training. Uses scalable radiance field construction and clustering for large scenes.

Result: Achieves on-the-fly processing for diverse capture scenarios and scene sizes, competitive in speed and quality.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient, scalable, and robust joint optimization of poses and 3DGS, suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

TL;DR: VoxelSplat is a novel regularization framework for camera-based occupancy prediction, enhancing 3D semantics and scene flow learning through 2D projection and self-supervised motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like occlusions and dynamic environments in 3D semantics and scene flow prediction.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for enhanced semantics supervision via 2D projection and self-supervised scene flow learning.

Result: Improves accuracy of semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation without increasing inference time.

Conclusion: VoxelSplat effectively integrates into existing models, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

TL;DR: PartCrafter is a 3D generative model that synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful 3D meshes from a single RGB image, using a unified compositional architecture without pre-segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce monolithic shapes or rely on segmented inputs, limiting flexibility and part-aware generation.

Method: PartCrafter uses a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) with a compositional latent space and hierarchical attention for structured generation.

Result: It outperforms existing methods in generating decomposable 3D meshes, even for non-visible parts, showcasing part-aware generative priors.

Conclusion: PartCrafter demonstrates the effectiveness of part-aware generation for 3D understanding and synthesis, with plans to release code and data.

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework, UniRes, is proposed for restoring images with complex degradations by combining specialized models, showing improved performance on in-the-wild data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizing image restoration to in-the-wild data with diverse and mixed degradations.

Method: Proposes UniRes, a flexible diffusion-based framework that integrates specialized models during diffusion sampling to handle complex degradations.

Result: Demonstrates consistent performance gains, especially for images with complex degradations, on both complex and single-degradation datasets.

Conclusion: UniRes effectively transfers knowledge from isolated tasks to complex in-the-wild degradations, offering flexibility and improved restoration quality.

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach for Real-SR, addressing task imbalance through novel task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-SR is challenging due to complex degradation patterns. Existing methods assume broad degradation spaces, but this work focuses on balancing degradation handling within a fixed space.

Method: Frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task problem, introducing a task definition framework, focal loss-based weighting, and adaptive data rebalancing.

Result: The method consistently outperforms others across all degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively balances degradation handling, improving Real-SR performance.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative visual grounding framework using LLMs to improve generalization in visual relationship detection (VRD), outperforming baselines on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of fixed predicate sets in VRD models by leveraging LLMs for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Method: An expectation-maximization (EM)-inspired framework alternates between generating scene graphs using LLMs and training a visual model to align hypotheses with perceptual evidence.

Result: Achieves mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on seen, unseen, and mixed predicate classification, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Grounded LLM priors show promise for scalable open-world visual understanding, enabling generalization beyond annotated data.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.

*Yimei Liu,Yakun Ju,Yuan Rao,Hao Fan,Junyu Dong,Feng Gao,Qian Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADR-MVS improves 3D urban reconstruction from aerial images by integrating monocular cues and adaptive depth ranges, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS methods for aerial images overlook key differences like varying depth ranges and low-detail features, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: ADR-MVS uses a depth range predictor with cross-attention discrepancy learning, adaptive range maps, and normal-guided cost aggregation for precise depth estimation.

Result: ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and München datasets with superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed ADR-MVS effectively addresses aerial image challenges, enhancing depth estimation accuracy and computational performance.

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TissUnet is a deep learning model for segmenting extracranial tissues (skull bone, fat, muscle) from brain MRI, validated across diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracranial tissues in brain MRI are underutilized for health assessment, lacking validated tools, especially for developing brains or pathology.

Method: TissUnet, trained on 155 MRI-CT pairs, segments tissues from T1-weighted MRI, validated on nine datasets including healthy and tumor cases.

Result: Achieved median Dice scores of 0.79-0.83, outperforming prior methods, with 89% acceptance in testing and strong performance in pediatric cases.

Conclusion: TissUnet provides fast, accurate segmentation, enabling large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology and health risks using standard MRI.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveAction is a new benchmark for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving, addressing gaps in scenario diversity, action-level annotation, and human-aligned evaluation. It uses real-world data and a tree-structured framework for comprehensive assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences.

Method: Introduces DriveAction, with 16,185 QA pairs from 2,610 driving scenarios, using real-world data and an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs need both vision and language inputs for accurate action prediction; accuracy drops significantly without either.

Conclusion: DriveAction provides a rigorous foundation for improving human-like decisions in autonomous driving and identifies model bottlenecks effectively.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies 3D token structures for MLLMs, comparing video-based and point-based representations. It introduces a novel method using 3D point cloud features, showing improved performance and competitive results with video-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective 3D scene representation for MLLMs is challenging, with existing methods relying on 2D features. The work aims to explore and improve 3D tokenization.

Method: Proposes enriching visual tokens with 3D point cloud features using a pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Compares video-based and point-based representations.

Result: Merging 3D features boosts performance. Point-based structures rival video-based ones with clever sampling. Achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis of token structures is a key contribution. Transparent reporting of results is emphasized for robust progress in the field.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoralCLIP introduces moral grounding into vision-language models using Moral Foundations Theory, improving moral content understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack moral reasoning, a key aspect of human cognition.

Method: MoralCLIP integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, using a multi-label dataset and moral data augmentation.

Result: Explicit moral supervision enhances unimodal and multimodal moral understanding.

Conclusion: MoralCLIP lays the groundwork for morally-aware AI systems aligned with human values.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a many-to-many Token Transforming framework for compressing vision transformers, unifying existing token reduction methods as matrix transformations. It achieves significant FLOPs reduction and speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token reduction methods in vision transformers cause information loss and require post-training. The paper aims to unify and generalize these methods while preserving information.

Method: The paper introduces a many-to-many Token Transforming framework, treating token reduction as explicit matrix transformations, enabling training-free acceleration.

Result: The framework reduces 40% FLOPs, accelerates DeiT-S by 1.5x with only 0.1% accuracy drop, and shows improvements in dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a better computation-performance trade-off, reduces budget, and accelerates inference across various tasks.

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

*Jingshun Huang,Haitao Lin,Tianyu Wang,Yanwei Fu,Yu-Gang Jiang,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOEO is a single-stage method for category-level pose estimation of articulated objects, improving efficiency and performance over multi-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-stage pipelines for pose estimation are computationally expensive and inefficient for real-time robotic tasks.

Method: YOEO uses a unified network for point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, followed by clustering and alignment to recover poses.

Result: The method achieves real-time performance at 200Hz and successfully interacts with unseen articulated objects in a real-world setting.

Conclusion: YOEO is effective for real-time robotic manipulation, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative to multi-stage approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

### [135] [Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05749)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether weighted figure of merit can replace Rosin's measure for comparing polygonal approximation schemes, concluding they are independent and not interchangeable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are related, allowing substitution in evaluating sub-optimal polygonal approximation schemes.

Method: Theoretical analysis, experimental investigation, and statistical analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient) using public datasets.

Result: The two measures are theoretically independent, experimentally uncorrelated, and cannot substitute each other.

Conclusion: Weighted figure of merit cannot replace Rosin's measure for comparing sub-optimal schemes due to their independence.

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Conclusion: The method is effective for 3D trajectory estimation from 2D data, with potential applications in sports and virtual replay.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking
sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an
LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is
independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of
intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large vision language models (LVLMs) can discern genuine and fake visual illusions, revealing they rely on prior knowledge rather than visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguities in assessing machine cognition of visual illusions by distinguishing genuine and fake illusions.

Method: Introduces a VQA dataset with genuine and fake illusions, evaluating LVLMs' ability to discern actual vs. apparent features.

Result: LVLMs predict the same answers for both genuine and fake illusions, suggesting reliance on prior knowledge, not visual understanding.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in LVLMs' visual cognition and provides a dataset for further research.

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel, model-agnostic approach addresses sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles by using timestamp offsets and data augmentation, improving performance under stale conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles causes temporal misalignment, degrading trajectory predictions critical for safety.

Method: Uses per-point timestamp offsets for LiDAR/radar relative to cameras and data augmentation to simulate realistic staleness. Integrated into a multi-sensor detection model.

Result: Outperforms conventional models, maintaining good performance under both synchronized and stale conditions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates sensor staleness, enhancing robustness in perception systems.

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)

leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for real-time audio-driven portrait video generation, addressing computational challenges with variable-length generation, consistency training, quantization, and expression control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are expressive but computationally heavy, limiting real-time use in interactive avatar applications. This work aims to enable low-latency, high-fidelity video generation.

Method: Proposes variable-length video generation, consistency training for fast few-step generation, model quantization, pipeline parallelism, and a new inference strategy for stability. Adds class labels for state switching and fine-grained facial control.

Result: Achieves 78 FPS at 384x384 and 45 FPS at 512x512, with latencies of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively, enabling fluid two-way communication.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances real-time performance and high-quality output, making it suitable for interactive avatar applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

*Ziwei Zhao,Zhixing Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Zhao Zhang,Haojun Yu,Dong Wang,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeformCL introduces a continuous representation for 3D blood vessel extraction using deformable centerlines, improving connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction over discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete representations in 3D medical imaging often lead to fractures or fragments, limiting accuracy for clinical diagnosis.

Method: DeformCL uses deformable centerlines with connected nodes and edges, trained via a cascaded pipeline.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets, validated by clinical imaging.

Conclusion: DeformCL offers superior performance and clinical relevance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

*Quansong He,Xiangde Min,Kaishen Wang,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-scale feature fusion method for UNet, addressing limitations in skip connections by treating them as discrete nodes and using an adaptive ODE method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip connections in UNet lack effective multi-scale interaction and rely on simple operations, limiting information integration. Recent improvements overlook these issues.

Method: The method reimagines UNet decoding as solving an initial value problem, using skip connections as discrete nodes and applying an adaptive ODE for multi-scale fusion.

Result: Experiments show improved feature utilization, fewer parameters, and high performance on medical image segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances UNet's skip connections, offering adaptability and efficiency without altering encoder/decoder architectures.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

*Marcin Kowalczyk,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hardware architecture (DIF filter) for noise reduction in event vision sensors, achieving high throughput and comparable performance to state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noise in event vision sensors, which varies with illumination and temperature, to improve data quality.

Method: Develops and implements the DIF filter on an FPGA chip, using a new high-resolution event dataset for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 403.39 MEPS (1280x720) and 428.45 MEPS (640x480) throughput, with AUROC scores of 0.844-0.999.

Conclusion: The DIF filter offers high throughput and robust noise reduction, comparable to state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

*Myungkyu Koo,Subin Kim,Sangkyung Kwak,Jaehyun Nam,Seojin Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FontAdapter enables fast, high-quality visual text generation in unseen fonts using a two-stage curriculum learning approach, avoiding costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting unseen fonts are slow and impractical for real-time use, requiring expensive fine-tuning.

Method: A two-stage curriculum learning approach: first extracting font attributes from isolated glyphs, then integrating styles into diverse backgrounds using synthetic datasets.

Result: FontAdapter achieves robust font customization without additional fine-tuning, supporting text editing, style blending, and cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: FontAdapter is a versatile, efficient framework for real-time font customization tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of object correspondence between ego and exo views by leveraging multimodal data and enforcing cross-view consistency.

Method: Proposes a multimodal condition fusion module for segmentation and a cross-view object alignment module to bridge the visual domain gap.

Result: Ranked second on the Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves object segmentation and correspondence across perspectives, demonstrating robustness to viewpoint changes.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

*Jinjuan Wang,Wenzhang Sun,Ming Li,Yun Zheng,Fanyao Li,Zhulin Tao,Donglin Di,Hao Li,Wei Chen,Xianglin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChronoTailor is a diffusion-based framework for video virtual try-on, ensuring temporal consistency and fine-grained garment detail preservation using spatio-temporal attention and multi-scale feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods struggle with maintaining continuity and reproducing garment details, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: ChronoTailor employs a spatio-temporal attention mechanism for feature integration, region-aware spatial guidance, and multi-scale garment feature preservation, alongside a new dataset (StyleDress).

Result: ChronoTailor outperforms previous methods in maintaining spatio-temporal continuity and preserving garment details during motion.

Conclusion: ChronoTailor advances video virtual try-on by addressing temporal and detail challenges, supported by a high-quality dataset.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method for detecting and delineating allergy wheals using a custom device (SPAT) with 32 images under varied lighting, outperforming single-image methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and accuracy in diagnosing inhalant allergies by leveraging multiple images under distinct lighting conditions.

Method: A two-part approach: a neural network for pixel-level wheal segmentation, followed by an algorithmic method for detection and delineation, using manually annotated data from 868 patients.

Result: The method, evaluated on 217 patients, shows higher accuracy with 32 SPAT images compared to a single conventionally lighted image.

Conclusion: Utilizing multiple images under varied lighting significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over traditional single-image approaches.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

*Jiakai Zhang,Shouchen Zhou,Haizhao Dai,Xinhang Liu,Peihao Wang,Zhiwen Fan,Yuan Pei,Jingyi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CryoFastAR is a geometric foundation model for fast pose estimation in cryo-EM, outperforming traditional iterative methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation in cryo-EM relies on slow iterative optimization due to noise and distortions. CryoFastAR aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: Integrates multi-view features and uses progressive training on simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations.

Result: Achieves comparable quality to traditional methods while significantly speeding up inference.

Conclusion: CryoFastAR offers a faster, accurate alternative for cryo-EM pose estimation, enabling near-atomic protein reconstruction.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Domain-RAG, a training-free framework for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) using retrieval-guided image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in CD-FSOD where existing methods fail to preserve object categories or align backgrounds with target domains.

Method: Uses domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided generation, and foreground-background composition to create domain-consistent images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD without additional training.

Conclusion: Domain-RAG effectively generates high-quality, domain-aligned samples, improving CD-FSOD performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: To improve autonomous driving by integrating high-level intent generation with low-level control, balancing latency and decision quality.

Method: Uses a fast-slow architecture with selective five-view prompting, multi-stage chain-of-thought reasoning, and spline-based trajectory post-processing.

Result: Achieved a Rater Feedback Score of 7.7367, ranking 2nd in the 2025 Waymo Challenge, outperforming the baseline by 2.77%.

Conclusion: HMVLM demonstrates effective integration of vision-language models for autonomous driving, enhancing decision-making and trajectory smoothness.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

*Yiheng Li,Yang Yang,Zichang Tan,Huan Liu,Weihua Chen,Xu Zhou,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCL, a method for detecting fake news by analyzing fine-grained consistency in multi-modal data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting fake news lack fine-grained analysis of local content, leading to unreliable detection of detailed forgeries.

Method: CSCL uses two branches (image and text) with cascaded decoders (CCD and SCD) to capture contextual and semantic consistency, leveraging token-pair supervision for forgery detection.

Result: CSCL outperforms existing methods on DGM4 datasets, particularly in grounding manipulated content.

Conclusion: CSCL enhances fine-grained forgery detection, setting a new benchmark for multi-modal fake news detection.

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based medical segmentation model using Mask2Former with deformable attention and offset adjustment strategies to improve segmentation of mid-sized and small organs, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation is challenging, especially for small organs, and existing transformer models are resource-heavy and underperform clinically.

Method: Combines Mask2Former with deformable attention, offset adjustment strategies, and an FCN-based auxiliary head for efficient training and better segmentation.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, particularly for mid-sized and small organs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of transformer-based models in medical segmentation, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS) to evaluate semantic segmentation models holistically, addressing gaps in current protocols that overlook reliability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for semi-supervised semantic segmentation focus only on accuracy, ignoring reliability and robustness, which are crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose RSS, a metric combining predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. They evaluate UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline.

Result: Semi-supervised methods often sacrifice reliability for accuracy. UniMatchV2 shows robustness in out-of-domain evaluations but still has reliability shortcomings.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for holistic metrics like RSS to align semi-supervised segmentation research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: FADE introduces a training-free video editing method using frequency-aware factorization and spectrum-guided modulation to leverage pre-trained video diffusion models, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with efficient editing due to computational demands, and conventional image diffusion models fail to handle video dynamics effectively.

Method: Analyzes attention patterns in video models, proposes factorization for component optimization, and uses spectrum-guided modulation for refined sampling.

Result: Delivers high-quality, realistic, and temporally coherent editing results in experiments.

Conclusion: FADE effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, offering a practical solution for video editing with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

### [158] [Dy3DGS-SLAM: Monocular 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05965)
*Mingrui Li,Yiming Zhou,Hongxing Zhou,Xinggang Hu,Florian Roemer,Hongyu Wang,Ahmad Osman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM is a monocular RGB-based SLAM method for dynamic scenes, using fused dynamic masks and motion loss to improve tracking and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM methods struggle with dynamic environments, especially with pure RGB input. Dy3DGS-SLAM aims to address this gap.

Method: Fuses optical flow and depth masks probabilistically, uses motion loss for pose estimation, and employs rendering loss for mapping.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic scenes, matching or surpassing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM effectively handles dynamic environments with monocular RGB input, advancing SLAM capabilities.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

TL;DR: The paper reviews Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques to improve cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis, addressing challenges like domain shifts and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle domain gaps in agricultural image analysis caused by environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods, which hinder model generalization.

Method: Systematic review of DA methods, categorized into shallow and deep learning models, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches, with a focus on adversarial learning.

Result: DA enhances performance in tasks like crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition across regions and seasons.

Conclusion: The review provides a framework for researchers, highlighting gaps and supporting DA advancements in agricultural image analysis.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Xin Wei,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCA-Bench, a unified benchmarking suite for evaluating the security robustness of diverse CAPTCHA types using a shared vision-language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a large-scale, multimodal benchmark for CAPTCHA evaluation prompted the creation of MCA-Bench to assess security robustness systematically.

Method: MCA-Bench integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single protocol, fine-tuning specialized cracking agents for each category using a shared vision-language model.

Result: Experiments show MCA-Bench effectively maps CAPTCHA vulnerabilities and provides the first quantitative analysis of challenge complexity, interaction depth, and solvability.

Conclusion: The paper proposes design principles for CAPTCHA hardening and identifies open challenges, encouraging community collaboration.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

### [161] [Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006)
*Yifu Qiu,Yftah Ziser,Anna Korhonen,Shay B. Cohen,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning vision-and-language foundation models for dynamics models is easier than for world models. Dynamics models can bootstrap world models via weakly supervised learning and inference-time verification, achieving competitive performance in action-centric image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if vision-and-language foundation models can realistically model world dynamics (observation-action-observation) and dynamics (observation-observation-action) when actions are language-based.

Method: Fine-tuning for dynamics models, then bootstrapping world models using weakly supervised learning (synthetic data) and inference-time verification (reward-based scoring). A new objective weights image tokens by importance.

Result: Best model achieves competitive performance in action-centric image editing, improving by 15% on real-world subsets (GPT4o-as-judge) and excelling in human evaluations.

Conclusion: Dynamics models are easier to acquire and can effectively bootstrap world models, leading to state-of-the-art performance in action-centric tasks.

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

*Alejandro Puente-Castro,Enrique Fernandez-Blanco,Daniel Rivero,Andres Molares-Ulloa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid ML and pretrained DL approach improves Orthopoxvirus classification from medical images, offering efficiency and scalability without data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic methods for Orthopoxvirus are slow and require expertise, with limited and biased datasets. Automated, scalable solutions are needed.

Method: Combines Machine Learning models with pretrained Deep Learning models for deep feature extraction, avoiding data augmentation.

Result: Achieves excellent classification performance with training and inference efficiency, showing strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable and interpretable, suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

*Xingchang Huang,Ashish Kumar Singh,Florian Dubost,Cristina Nader Vasconcelos,Sakar Khattar,Liang Shi,Christian Theobalt,Cengiz Oztireli,Gurprit Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new pipeline for stereo video generation and enhancement, outperforming existing methods by fine-tuning on degraded data and using warped masks for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on high-quality monocular videos, limiting their applicability. This work addresses stereo generation and restoration for low-quality inputs.

Method: Fine-tuning on degraded data for restoration and conditioning on warped masks for consistent stereo generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for stereo video generation and restoration, even with small datasets and low-quality inputs.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

### [165] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI), a framework that adaptively adjusts noise levels in diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods for each sample, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBP methods use a constant noise level for all samples, but the paper finds that optimal noise levels vary per sample, motivating the need for adaptive noise injection.

Method: SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate sample deviations from clean data (score norms) and adjusts noise levels adaptively via a reweighting function.

Result: SSNI improves accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K when integrated with existing DBP methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive noise injection per sample is crucial for DBP methods, as demonstrated by SSNI's success.

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR, a novel method with two adapters (AutoKL and CLIP), reconstructs complex visual stimuli from fMRI by fusing topological and semantic information, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately reconstructing highly complex visual stimuli from fMRI due to their density, diversity, and multifaceted semantics.

Method: HAVIR uses AutoKL Adapter for topological structures and CLIP Adapter for semantic information, fused by Versatile Diffusion.

Result: HAVIR effectively reconstructs structural and semantic features, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: HAVIR addresses the limitations of current methods by combining topological and semantic representations for superior image reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tensor-to-tensor layer (FIS) with linear cost is proposed for efficient deep learning on high-dimensional data, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of processing high-dimensional tensor data (e.g., images) in deep learning by developing a subquadratic-cost layer.

Method: Utilizes 'corner trees' and a multiparameter generalization of iterated integrals/sums to create the FIS layer, integrating it into neural networks.

Result: FIS matches accuracy of larger ResNet with fewer parameters (0.1% difference) and achieves 97.3% AUROC in anomaly detection on MVTec AD.

Conclusion: The FIS layer offers an efficient, scalable solution for tensor data processing, validated in classification and anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDS-Net improves infrared small target detection by modeling shallow and deep features separately and fusing them adaptively, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based IRSTD methods inefficiently handle shallow-deep feature heterogeneity and lack systematic feature fusion, limiting performance and increasing computational costs.

Method: Proposes SDS-Net with a dual-branch architecture for structural and semantic feature modeling, plus an adaptive fusion module for cross-layer feature collaboration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1K) with high precision and low computational complexity.

Conclusion: SDS-Net offers superior detection performance and efficiency, with broad application potential in IRSTD tasks.

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical image analysis under split conformal prediction (SCP), proposing full conformal adaptation and SS-Text to improve efficiency and maintain coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite VLMs' discriminative potential in medical image analysis, their reliability under SCP remains overlooked, especially with zero-shot limitations and few-shot transfer learning challenges.

Method: Proposes full conformal adaptation for joint adaptation and conformalization of VLMs, along with SS-Text, a training-free linear probe solver, to enhance efficiency.

Result: Experiments with 3 medical VLMs and 9 tasks show up to 27% improvement in set efficiency while maintaining coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses VLM reliability under SCP, offering a practical solution for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WisWheat is a wheat-specific dataset designed to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for wheat management tasks, outperforming general-purpose models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wheat management relies on costly, subjective expert inspections. VLMs lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to poor performance in wheat tasks.

Method: WisWheat includes three datasets: pretraining (image-caption pairs), quantitative (VQA-style triplets), and instruction fine-tuning (stress diagnosis and management).

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on WisWheat improves accuracy significantly (79.2% for stress, 84.6% for growth stages), surpassing GPT-4o by 11.9% and 34.6%.

Conclusion: WisWheat effectively bridges the domain gap for VLMs in wheat management, offering scalable, data-driven solutions.

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FBG improves conditional diffusion models by dynamically adjusting guidance based on sample needs, outperforming CFG and matching LIG on ImageNet512x512.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's constant guidance harms diversity and induces memorization; FBG addresses this by adapting guidance dynamically.

Method: FBG uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance, derived from a linear corruption assumption of the conditional distribution.

Result: FBG outperforms CFG on ImageNet512x512 and adapts guidance scales effectively for text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: FBG offers a mathematically grounded, adaptive alternative to fixed guidance schemes like CFG and LIG.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

TL;DR: CLaMR is a multimodal retriever that dynamically selects modalities for improved video content retrieval, outperforming single- and multi-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieval systems treat video modalities independently, leading to noisy results. A dynamic, joint approach is needed for better relevance scoring.

Method: CLaMR jointly indexes 4 modalities (video frames, speech, text, metadata) using a unified backbone. It uses MultiVENT 2.0++ for training and a modality-aware loss.

Result: CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over single-modality and 35.4 over multi-modality retrievers on MultiVENT 2.0++. It also boosts QA performance.

Conclusion: CLaMR demonstrates superior retrieval by dynamically leveraging modalities, validated by synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

### [173] [VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06097)
*Zikang Wang,Boyu Chen,Zhengrong Yue,Yi Wang,Yu Qiao,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1 introduces a novel agent paradigm for long video understanding by focusing on relevant shots, outperforming existing methods and competing with closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long videos due to redundant or noisy temporal context, lacking deep understanding of relevant shots.

Method: VideoChat-A1 uses a chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm to progressively select and analyze relevant shots in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (77.0 on VideoMME, 70.1 on EgoSchema), outperforming baselines by up to 10.8% and 6.2%.

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1 effectively mimics human thinking for long video understanding, offering competitive accuracy with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

*Zhanwen Liu,Huanna Song,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shangyu Xie,Yisheng An,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiLIE framework enhances low-light images using event cameras, addressing noise and structural issues with frequency filtering and cross-attention fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras lose details and blur in low light; event-guided methods ignore noise and structural issues.

Method: Uses Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) for noise suppression and Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) for smoother representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Conclusion: BiLIE effectively enhances low-light images, addressing prior limitations with innovative modules and a new dataset (RELIE).

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

*Peter Lengyel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCLSTM, a lightweight convolutional architecture for predicting dynamic agents' future states in autonomous driving, outperforming transformer-based methods without relying on vectorized inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting agent states depend on high-quality vectorized inputs and computationally heavy transformers, which are impractical in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM), a lightweight, end-to-end trainable model using convolutional operations to capture temporal and spatial dynamics without self-attention.

Result: CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and ranks first in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.

Conclusion: CCLSTM offers a practical and efficient solution for predicting agent states, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

### [176] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)
*Wenyuan Li,Shunlin Liang,Yuxiang Zhang,Liqin Liu,Keyan Chen,Yongzhe Chen,Han Ma,Jianglei Xu,Yichuan Ma,Shikang Guan,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H2Crop, a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset combining EnMAP hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 time series for fine-grained crop classification. A dual-stream Transformer architecture is proposed, improving classification accuracy by 4.2% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained crop classification is essential for precision agriculture and food security but is hindered by challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and annotation costs.

Method: The study integrates 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series into the H2Crop dataset. A dual-stream Transformer architecture processes these modalities, with specialized pathways for spectral-spatial and temporal features.

Result: Adding hyperspectral data improves F1-scores by 4.2% on average (peaking at 6.3%). The method outperforms existing deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: H2Crop and the proposed dual-stream Transformer architecture provide a robust benchmark and solution for fine-grained crop classification, demonstrating the value of hyperspectral data.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MF$^2$, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to comprehend and recall key narrative details from full-length movies, highlighting current model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLMs focus on superficial details or use semi-automated questions, failing to assess deep comprehension of long-form video content.

Method: MF$^2$ includes 50+ movies with manually crafted claim pairs (true vs. false) targeting core narrative elements, evaluated via binary claim identification.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans, revealing their inability to retain and reason over critical narrative information.

Conclusion: MF$^2$ exposes the gap between human and model performance in narrative comprehension, emphasizing the need for improved VLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online mistake detection framework for real-time video analysis, addressing both procedural and execution errors, and uses an LLM for feedback. It ranks second on the HoloAssist benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online mistake detection is crucial in domains like industrial automation and education, but existing work focuses only on procedural errors, leaving broader error types unaddressed.

Method: The proposed framework detects procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips, tool misuse) in real-time video and uses an LLM to generate feedback.

Result: The approach ranks second on the HoloAssist benchmark for mistake detection, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses broader error types and provides real-time feedback, demonstrating practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack interpretability or struggle with high-dimensional multi-spectral data. SatelliteFormula aims to bridge this gap by integrating data-driven learning with physical understanding.

Method: Uses a Vision Transformer-based encoder for feature extraction and a symbolic optimizer with physics-guided constraints to derive interpretable expressions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in performance, stability, and generalization on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula successfully bridges the gap between data-driven models and physical interpretability, enabling better modeling of environmental variables.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STSBench is a framework for benchmarking vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving, focusing on spatio-temporal reasoning. It introduces STSnu, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs on complex traffic scenarios using the NuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLMs focus on single-viewpoint tasks like object recognition, lacking evaluation of spatio-temporal reasoning crucial for autonomous driving. STSBench addresses this gap.

Method: STSBench mines traffic scenarios from datasets, provides a UI for human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions. STSnu evaluates VLMs on 43 scenarios with 971 questions.

Result: Evaluation reveals VLMs' shortcomings in reasoning about traffic dynamics, emphasizing the need for improved spatio-temporal modeling.

Conclusion: STSBench fills a critical gap in VLM evaluation, enabling development of more robust models for autonomous driving.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), a multi-round interactive task for refining image searches based on mental images. It proposes GenIR, a generative retrieval method using diffusion models to provide clear visual feedback, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between vision-language models' success in benchmarks and real-world applications, where human search is multi-round and guided by mental images.

Method: Proposes GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm using diffusion-based image generation to provide explicit visual feedback. Also introduces an automated pipeline for dataset generation.

Result: GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario.

Conclusion: Establishes MIR as a new task with a dataset and effective method, laying groundwork for future research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' capabilities in endoscopic tasks, particularly laparoscopic surgery, and compare specialized vs. generalist models.

Method: Evaluated VLMs on surgical datasets with human annotations, focusing on basic perception and advanced scene understanding tasks.

Result: VLMs perform well on basic tasks but poorly on medical knowledge tasks. Specialized medical VLMs underperform generalist models.

Conclusion: Further advancements are needed to optimize VLMs for surgical environments, highlighting key areas for improvement.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Motivation: Standard PyTorch data loaders underutilize GPUs when streaming GeoTIFF files from cloud storage, necessitating optimized configurations.

Method: Benchmarked GeoTIFF loading throughput from cloud and local SSD, tested loader configurations and data parameters, used Bayesian optimization for optimal settings.

Result: 20x remote and 4x local throughput improvement, same accuracy as local training, 6-15% IoU boost, 85-95% GPU utilization.

Conclusion: Optimized configurations enable efficient deep learning on large-scale EO data, matching local training performance with high GPU utilization.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of 'conceptualization'—AI's ability to recognize and reason about concepts despite visual variations—a key human reasoning skill.

Method: VGA uses six graph-based tasks with diverse layouts to test representation-invariant reasoning, evaluating state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs.

Result: Humans achieved near-perfect accuracy, while AI models failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks, indicating pseudo-intelligent pattern matching.

Conclusion: VGA highlights fundamental AI limitations in visual understanding and provides a framework to advance human-like conceptualization in AI models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Result: Identified key tasks, advancements, and benchmark datasets, highlighting current limitations and future opportunities.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inspire advancements in AI video understanding by unifying dual perspectives, moving toward human-like perception.

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

### [186] [BecomingLit: Relightable Gaussian Avatars with Hybrid Neural Shading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06271)
*Jonathan Schmidt,Simon Giebenhain,Matthias Niessner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BecomingLit introduces a method for creating relightable, high-resolution head avatars using a low-cost light stage setup and a hybrid neural shading approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to reconstruct relightable, high-resolution head avatars efficiently, enabling interactive rendering from novel viewpoints and easy animation from monocular videos.

Method: The method involves a low-cost light stage setup for data capture, a relightable avatar representation using 3D Gaussian primitives, and a hybrid neural shading approach combining neural diffuse BRDF with analytical specular terms.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment, validated through extensive experiments on a novel dataset.

Conclusion: BecomingLit successfully achieves high-quality, relightable avatars with efficient animation and relighting capabilities, advancing the field of avatar reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

*Jiatao Gu,Tianrong Chen,David Berthelot,Huangjie Zheng,Yuyang Wang,Ruixiang Zhang,Laurent Dinh,Miguel Angel Bautista,Josh Susskind,Shuangfei Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARFlow is a scalable generative model using normalizing flows and Transformers for high-resolution image synthesis, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scalability and performance of normalizing flows in high-resolution image synthesis by combining their strengths with Autoregressive Transformers.

Method: Introduces Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow) with a deep-shallow design, latent space modeling, and a novel guidance algorithm for improved scalability and sample quality.

Result: STARFlow achieves competitive performance in class- and text-conditional image generation, matching diffusion models in quality.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the first successful application of normalizing flows at large scale and high resolution, bridging the gap with other generative models.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExAct is a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled human activities, revealing a performance gap between VLMs and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a benchmark for evaluating nuanced, expert-level understanding of physical human skills in video-language models.

Method: ExAct includes 3,521 expert-curated video QA pairs across 11 activities in 6 domains, with 5 candidate answers per question.

Result: GPT-4o achieves 44.70% accuracy, significantly below human experts' 82.02%.

Conclusion: ExAct is a valuable tool for advancing VLMs in understanding human skills, with data and code publicly available.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human
specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing
and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various
physical and procedural domains. Dataset and code are available at

*Shi Liu,Weijie Su,Xizhou Zhu,Wenhai Wang,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMemo introduces a dual-path architecture and RoPE-DHR positional encoding to address visual neglect and 2D structural loss in LVLMs, outperforming conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs, built on LLMs, suffer from visual neglect and poor 2D spatial awareness due to inherited LLM designs.

Method: Proposes CoMemo (dual-path architecture) and RoPE-DHR (positional encoding) to improve visual processing and spatial relationships.

Result: Outperforms conventional LVLMs in benchmarks for long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: CoMemo effectively addresses key limitations in LVLMs, enhancing multimodal processing capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraFM is a self-supervised learning model for Earth observation, leveraging global Sentinel-1/2 imagery and land-cover aware sampling to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models lack scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity, limiting transferability.

Method: Uses modality-specific patch embeddings, adaptive cross-attention fusion, and local-global contrastive learning with dual-centering for long-tailed distributions.

Result: Outperforms prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench for classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: TerraFM advances EO by unifying radar/optical inputs and addressing data limitations, with publicly available code/models.

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

### [191] [A Path to Loving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05352)
*John Beverley,Regina Hurley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a rigorous ontological framework for understanding love, combining passive sensations and active judgments, and applies it to AI and sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the philosophical and scientific complexity of love, balancing its involuntary and rational aspects, and enhance AI applications.

Method: Uses Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and applied ontological methods to differentiate senses of love, defending a causal correlation model.

Result: A precise and scalable ontological account of love, linking affective and cognitive components.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for formal inquiry into love in ontology engineering, AI, and sciences.

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

### [192] [Contextual Memory Intelligence -- A Foundational Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration and Reflective Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05370)
*Kristy Wedel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI) to address memory limitations in generative AI systems, enabling adaptive, explainable, and responsible decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI systems lack full context storage and reflection, leading to repeated errors and unclear decision-making.

Method: CMI formalizes context capture, inference, and regeneration, operationalized through the Insight Layer with human-in-the-loop reflection, drift detection, and rationale preservation.

Result: CMI enhances reasoning with data, history, and context, improving AI system effectiveness, auditability, and social responsibility.

Conclusion: CMI provides a framework for building reflective, auditable, and socially responsible AI systems, improving human-AI collaboration and institutional resilience.

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

*Andrei T. Patrascu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework replaces reward-based optimization with constructive logical inference for decision-making, ensuring verifiable preconditions and guaranteed validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning, such as unsafe transitions and lack of interpretability, by grounding decision-making in constructive logic.

Method: Actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions, with decision-making based on constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic. A symbolic agent operates in a structured gridworld, chaining subgoals with logical constraints.

Result: The method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behavior, and efficient convergence without invalid actions, outperforming Q-learning.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction for reinforcement learning, emphasizing constructive logic and proof theory for safe planning and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

TL;DR: BSDS is a business-centric data system integrating AI agents, modular architecture, and human alignment to enhance adaptability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data platforms prioritize tools over business alignment, causing inefficiencies. BSDS aims to bridge this gap.

Method: BSDS uses a modular architecture with curated data, AI agents, and optimized workflows, aligning technical and business needs.

Result: BSDS improves time-to-market, collaboration, and scalability, validated through real-world implementation.

Conclusion: BSDS transforms data systems into dynamic business enablers, with future research potential in AI and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

*Rodney Sanchez,Ferat Sahin,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically-inspired intrinsic reward function using a memory-augmented neural network to deter exploration of terminal states, mimicking fear conditioning in animals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of engineered extrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning, especially for states like 'death' that lack feedback, by drawing inspiration from amygdala development.

Method: Proposes a novel memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture to generate intrinsic rewards, tested in the Miniworld Sidewalk POMDP environment.

Result: The intrinsic motivation successfully induces avoidance behavior akin to fear conditioning, with adjustable thresholds producing behaviors resembling general anxiety disorders.

Conclusion: The study presents a biologically-inspired framework for fear conditioning in RL agents, enabling them to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KITE, a framework to evaluate AI-human knowledge transfer, revealing that benchmark performance doesn't consistently predict successful transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI reasoning improvements enhance knowledge transfer to humans.

Method: Two-phase human study (N=118) where humans ideate with AI and then independently implement solutions, isolating explanation influence.

Result: Benchmark performance correlates with outcomes but inconsistently, showing knowledge transfer needs dedicated optimization.

Conclusion: Knowledge transfer requires specific optimization; behavioral and strategic factors mediate success.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMTU is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs on expert-level table tasks, highlighting gaps in current model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for table-related tasks are limited and narrowly focused, missing the broader spectrum of real-world challenges faced by professionals.

Method: MMTU introduces over 30K questions across 25 complex table tasks, derived from decades of research, to assess table understanding, reasoning, and coding skills.

Result: Frontier models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: MMTU aims to drive advances in foundation models for structured data processing by providing a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

TL;DR: MAPPS is a framework for autonomous materials discovery, integrating workflow planning, physics, and scientist feedback, achieving improved stability and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomy in language agents for materials discovery by automating workflow planning and incorporating physics and scientist intuition.

Method: MAPPS combines a Workflow Planner (using LLMs), a Tool Code Generator (for executable Python code), and a Scientific Mediator (for feedback and robustness).

Result: Achieves a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates on the MP-20 dataset compared to prior generative models.

Conclusion: MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery, demonstrated through diverse experiments.

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

*Kihyun Kim,Jiawei Zhang,Asuman Ozdaglar,Pablo A. Parrilo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel preference learning framework ensures policies align proportionally with evaluator preferences, addressing bias in conventional methods by incorporating social choice axioms and a soft-max relaxation for trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods bias policies toward widely held opinions, disadvantaging some groups. This paper aims to align policies with true population preferences.

Method: Infers evaluator population distributions from pairwise comparisons, constructs policies satisfying social choice axioms, and uses a soft-max relaxation for trade-offs.

Result: Validated effectiveness and scalability on tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances population-proportional representation with Condorcet winner selection, offering a robust solution for preference learning.

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces reasoning graphs to analyze large-scale reasoning models, revealing structural advantages like cyclicity, diameter, and small-world properties, which correlate with performance and task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of large-scale reasoning models and improve their interpretability and efficacy.

Method: Extracts reasoning graphs by clustering hidden-state representations and analyzes graph-theoretic properties (cyclicity, diameter, small-world index) across tasks and model variants.

Result: Distilled models show more recurrent cycles, larger diameters, and small-world traits, with structural advantages scaling with task difficulty and model capacity. Fine-tuning expands diameters and improves performance.

Conclusion: The study links reasoning graph structures to model performance, offering insights for dataset design and advancing interpretability and efficacy of reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) suffer from long inference times due to sequential chains-of-thought.

Method: SPRINT uses a data curation pipeline to reorganize reasoning into parallelizable subtasks and fine-tunes LRMs.

Result: Models fine-tuned with SPRINT reduce sequential tokens by ~39% on long problems and maintain performance.

Conclusion: SPRINT effectively parallelizes reasoning, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

### [202] [Constrained Sampling for Language Models Should Be Easy: An MCMC Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05754)
*Emmanuel Anaya Gonzalez,Sairam Vaidya,Kanghee Park,Ruyi Ji,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new MCMC-based constrained sampling framework for LMs ensures constraint satisfaction, convergence to true distribution, and efficiency, outperforming existing methods in program fuzzing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained-decoding approaches distort model distributions, limiting diversity and validity in applications like program fuzzing.

Method: Proposes a framework using MCMC with a proposal distribution over valid outputs and Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on LM likelihood.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances constraint satisfaction, convergence, and efficiency, proving superior in practical applications.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

*Yesheng Zhang,Wenjian Sun,Yuheng Chen,Qingwei Liu,Qi Lin,Rui Zhang,Xu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory Entropy to refine the level-k game framework for autonomous driving, improving accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current level-k game frameworks treat agent interactions uniformly, ignoring varying complexities and dynamic changes, leading to redundant computations.

Method: Proposes Trajectory Entropy to quantify game status using uncertainty signals from trajectory predictions, refining the framework with a gating mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo and nuPlan datasets, improving precision by up to 19.89% for prediction and 16.48% for planning.

Conclusion: Trajectory Entropy effectively addresses the limitations of uniform treatment in level-k frameworks, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multilevel framework for explainable AI (XAI) to align explanations with diverse stakeholder needs, emphasizing trust-building through algorithmic, human-centered, and social layers, with LLMs enhancing accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for trustworthy and explainable AI in sensitive domains has grown, but existing XAI methods often overlook diverse audience needs.

Method: A multilevel framework is introduced, consisting of algorithmic/domain-based, human-centered, and social explainability layers, leveraging LLMs for natural language explanations.

Result: Case studies show the framework improves technical fidelity, user engagement, and societal accountability, enhancing trust in AI.

Conclusion: The paper reframes XAI as a dynamic, trust-building process by addressing diverse stakeholder expectations through a layered approach.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of costly data collection and system evaluation in developing real-time perceptual task guidance systems.

Method: Introduces a data curation pipeline for synthetic dialogues, automatic evaluation metrics, and an end-to-end model for streaming video processing.

Result: Creation of a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset and validated evaluation metrics, enabling real-time proactive AI assistance.

Conclusion: The framework advances the development of real-time AI assistants for task guidance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and
labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address
these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants
capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment of LLMs with human values by addressing issues like causal misidentification and preference heterogeneity in reward modeling.

Method: Frames reward modeling causally, leveraging causal inference tools to identify assumptions and contrast with common data practices.

Result: Demonstrates failure modes of naive reward models and shows causally-inspired methods enhance robustness.

Conclusion: Advocates for targeted interventions to overcome observational data limitations and outlines future research directions.

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrimeMind, an LLM-driven ABM framework, integrates Routine Activity Theory to model urban crime, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban crime modeling is complex, requiring understanding of subtle cues. Existing methods (ABMs and deep learning) lack accuracy, interpretability, or adaptability.

Method: Combines LLMs with ABM, integrates Routine Activity Theory, and aligns perception with human judgment using a training-free textual gradient method.

Result: Achieves up to 24% improvement in crime hotspot prediction and accurately reflects counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: CrimeMind offers fine-grained, adaptable crime modeling and effective evaluation of real-world interventions.

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

*Kostis Michailidis,Dimos Tsouros,Tias Guns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CP-Bench, a diverse benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM-driven constraint modelling, comparing three frameworks and improving LLM accuracy to 70% with advanced prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diverse evaluation datasets for constraint modelling, hindering the adoption of LLMs as CP modelling assistants.

Method: Introduces CP-Bench, evaluates LLMs on three constraint modelling frameworks (MiniZinc, CPMpy, OR-Tools CP-SAT), and tests prompt-based and inference-time compute methods.

Result: Python-based frameworks are more convenient, and documentation-rich prompts with self-verification achieve up to 70% accuracy.

Conclusion: CP-Bench fills a critical gap, and LLMs show promise for CP modelling with improved prompting techniques.

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weakly decomposable approach for large-scale itinerary planning, proposing a multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm to address component imbalance and interactions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale itinerary planning is complex due to the need to maximize POI scores while minimizing travel time and cost under constraints, requiring decomposable solutions.

Method: A weakly decomposable definition is introduced, followed by a multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm with dynamic decomposition, optimization potential, and resource allocation strategies.

Result: The algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with advantages scaling with problem size, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Weak decomposability and the proposed algorithm effectively address large-scale itinerary planning challenges, offering scalable performance.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

Motivation: To explore the impact of ILP preprocessing on MaxSAT solving efficiency.

Method: Investigates ILP preprocessing techniques and their application in MaxSAT solvers like WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200.

Result: ILP preprocessing helps solve 15 more instances and reduces the need for ILP solvers in portfolios.

Conclusion: ILP preprocessing enhances MaxSAT solving and reduces dependency on ILP solvers.

Abstract: The Maximum Satisfiability problem (MaxSAT) is a major optimization challenge
with numerous practical applications. In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT
solvers have adopted an ILP solver as part of their portfolios. This paper
investigates the impact of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) preprocessing
techniques on MaxSAT solving. Experimental results show that ILP preprocessing
techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024
in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current
state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios,
while our proposed approach reduces the need to call an ILP solver in a
portfolio including WMaxCDCL or MaxCDCL.

TL;DR: PersonaAgent introduces a personalized LLM agent framework with memory and action modules, outperforming baselines in adaptability and real-time user alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack flexibility for user-specific needs, prompting the development of PersonaAgent for personalized tasks.

Method: Integrates personalized memory (episodic/semantic) and action modules, with a persona prompt intermediary. Uses test-time alignment via simulated interactions.

Result: Outperforms baselines in personalization and scalability, demonstrating effective real-time user preference alignment.

Conclusion: PersonaAgent shows feasibility in delivering dynamic, tailored user experiences, highlighting its potential for personalized LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

TL;DR: RefPlan improves offline RL by unifying uncertainty modeling and model-based planning, enhancing performance under limited data and changing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with high epistemic uncertainty and lacks adaptivity due to fixed conservative policies.

Method: Proposes Reflect-then-Plan (RefPlan), a doubly Bayesian offline model-based planning approach that updates beliefs over dynamics and incorporates uncertainty into planning.

Result: RefPlan outperforms conservative offline RL policies, showing robustness under uncertainty and adaptability to changing dynamics.

Conclusion: RefPlan enhances flexibility, generalizability, and robustness of offline-learned policies.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing legal, privacy, and strategic constraints in procuring high-quality data for LLMs, while avoiding reliance on unverifiable trust or ignoring provider costs.

Method: Introduces Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA) and Marginal Utility Token (MUT), unified in Mixed-MIA, to ensure DSIC, individual rationality, and budget balance.

Result: Outperforms volume-based and trust-based baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while being robust to misreporting and collusion.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bargaining perspective to simplify the computational complexity of Bayesian persuasion in long-term interactions, distinguishing between informational and first-proposer advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian persuasion is effective in one-shot scenarios but becomes computationally complex (NP-hard) in long-term interactions, necessitating a simpler framework.

Method: The authors propose a bargaining perspective, unifying long-term persuasion with fairness and Pareto efficiency, and validate it using LLMs (GPT-3 and DeepSeek-R1).

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes between informational and first-proposer advantages and aligns with LLM-tested outcomes.

Conclusion: The bargaining perspective simplifies long-term Bayesian persuasion, offering a balanced and computationally feasible approach.

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for forming optimal microgrid coalitions to balance energy markets using cooperative game theory and a memetic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of renewable energy sources creates market imbalances, necessitating intelligent mechanisms to prevent outages and financial losses.

Method: The problem is modeled as an optimization problem solved by combining cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm, where individuals represent coalitions and evolve via recombination and mutation.

Result: The method identifies optimal coalitions by evaluating fitness based on profit, savings, and trading costs, with equitable distribution via the Shapley value.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively manages energy market dynamics by forming optimal microgrid coalitions, ensuring stability and efficiency.

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

TL;DR: MLM4HG introduces a method using masked language modeling to improve generalization in heterogeneous graph learning by converting graphs to text sequences and unifying tasks under a cloze-style paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs struggle with generalization across domains and tasks, and integrating them with LLMs often leads to biased comprehension due to embedding disparities.

Method: MLM4HG converts HGs to metapath-based textual sequences, unifies tasks with cloze-style templates, and fine-tunes a pretrained LM with constrained vocabulary.

Result: MLM4HG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain and multi-task experiments, showing superior generalization in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: MLM4HG effectively addresses generalization challenges in heterogeneous graph learning by leveraging textual sequences and unified task templates.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

TL;DR: Disaggregated inference improves throughput-interactivity trade-offs, especially for prefill-heavy workloads and larger models, but deployment is complex. Dynamic rate matching and elastic scaling are key for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and system-level challenges in deploying disaggregated inference at scale, and to explore its potential benefits.

Method: Systematic study evaluating hundreds of thousands of design points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations.

Result: Disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic and larger models, with dynamic rate matching and elastic scaling being crucial for Pareto-optimal performance.

Conclusion: Disaggregated inference offers actionable insights for balancing throughput and interactivity, though deployment requires careful optimization.

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

*Boyuan Deng,Luca Rossini,Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Nikolaos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for wheeled-legged robots integrates dynamic reward shaping and curriculum learning to achieve robust fall recovery, reducing joint torque and improving stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for fall recovery in wheeled-legged robots often fail due to reliance on preplanned motions or sparse rewards.

Method: The framework uses Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping, curriculum learning, and an asymmetric actor-critic architecture with noise-injected observations.

Result: Achieves recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%, reduces joint torque by 15.8% and 26.2%, and improves stabilization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robust and efficient fall recovery for wheeled-legged robots without platform-specific tuning.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

*Chongshang Yan,Jiaxuan He,Delun Li,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active object navigation framework (EAM and MHR) to address performance decline in zero-shot object navigation by leveraging scene information and improving path efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments with novel targets suffers from performance decline due to neglected scene information and inefficient long-range searching.

Method: The framework includes an Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) for scene reasoning and a MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) for efficient frontier exploration.

Result: EAM achieves 64.5% scene mapping accuracy, and navigation improves SPLs by 21.4% and 46.0% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances navigation performance by integrating scene reasoning and efficient path planning.

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

*Hongyan Zhi,Peihao Chen,Siyuan Zhou,Yubo Dong,Quanxi Wu,Lei Han,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D flow world model, ManiFlow-110k, to teach robots manipulation skills by predicting object movements in 3D space, enabling cross-embodiment adaptation without hardware-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with manipulation tasks due to lack of large, uniform datasets. Humans excel by understanding object movement in 3D space, which is embodiment-agnostic.

Method: A 3D optical flow dataset is synthesized, and a video diffusion-based world model learns manipulation physics. Flow-guided rendering and GPT-4o assess task alignment, optimizing robot actions.

Result: The model generalizes well across diverse tasks and adapts reliably to different robots without hardware-specific training.

Conclusion: The 3D flow world model effectively bridges the gap in robot manipulation learning, offering robust and unified action representation.

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

GPS waypoints. The AdaptiveDecompositionCPP algorithm combines cellular
decomposition with an adaptive merging strategy to reduce non-mowing travel

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot navigation systems lack adaptability in diverse indoor environments due to reliance on small models or rule-based systems.

Method: Astra-Global uses a multimodal LLM for self and goal localization with a hybrid topological-semantic graph. Astra-Local employs a 4D spatial-temporal encoder for path planning and odometry, using flow matching and masked ESDF loss.

Result: Astra achieves high end-to-end mission success rates in diverse indoor environments when deployed on real robots.

Conclusion: Astra's dual-model architecture effectively addresses adaptability and performance challenges in complex indoor navigation.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

### [223] [A Red Teaming Roadmap Towards System-Level Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05376)
*Zifan Wang,Christina Q. Knight,Jeremy Kritz,Willow E. Primack,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM red teaming research, advocating for prioritizing product safety specifications, realistic threat models, and system-level safety to address emerging AI threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM red teaming research lacks focus on critical priorities like product safety and realistic threats, hindering effective mitigation of misuse.

Method: The paper proposes shifting red teaming priorities to align with clear safety specifications, realistic threat models, and system-level safety measures.

Result: The critique highlights gaps in current research and suggests a framework for more effective red teaming.

Conclusion: Adopting the proposed priorities is essential for red teaming research to address evolving AI threats effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ECLIPSE is a novel black-box adversarial attack method for computer vision, balancing robustness, stealthiness to detection, and human inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in black-box scenarios where attackers have limited access.

Method: ECLIPSE uses Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local surrogate model to craft adversarial examples.

Result: Experiments show ECLIPSE effectively balances robustness, stealthiness to detection, and human inspection.

Conclusion: ECLIPSE advances adversarial attack methods by addressing trade-offs between key properties.

Abstract: Deep learning systems, critical in domains like autonomous vehicles, are
vulnerable to adversarial examples (crafted inputs designed to mislead
classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

### [225] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FERRET, a 1-bit gradient compression method, achieves mutual-information differential privacy (MI-DP) with no additive noise, outperforming DPSGD in perplexity and efficiency while matching non-private training utility in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy-utility-performance trilemma in gradient compression, ensuring formal privacy guarantees without additive noise.

Method: Proposes FERRET, which transmits one sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking, proving MI-DP with privacy loss epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2.

Result: FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH outperforms DPSGD in perplexity (3.98 vs 11.61 at epsilon=0.5) and efficiency (19-33% of DPSGD's training time).

Conclusion: FERRET advances sign-based MI-DP, balancing privacy, utility, and performance, and shows masked 1-bit updates can match non-private utility.

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

*Mingjie Chen,Tiancheng Zhu,Mingxue Zhang,Yiling He,Minghao Lin,Penghui Li,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel optimization for adversarial attacks on binary code similarity detection (BCSD) models, improving attack success rates, efficiency, and transferability by leveraging black-box explainers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior adversarial attack methods for BCSD models lack a solid theoretical basis and are inefficient for complex programs. This work aims to address these limitations, especially for targeted attacks.

Method: The approach uses black-box, model-agnostic explainers to identify critical code snippets for semantic-preserving perturbations, optimizing adversarial attacks.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher attack success rates, efficiency, and transferability compared to state-of-the-art attacks, validated through evaluations and real-world case studies.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need to enhance the robustness of BCSD models, given the demonstrated security implications of the proposed attacks.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Leverages ModernBERT-large architecture, fine-tuned on diverse datasets including attack types and benign instructions.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (0.987) and F1-score (0.980) on unseen test sets and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sentinel is a highly effective solution for detecting prompt injection attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

*Ya Jiang,Chuxiong Wu,Massieh Kordi Boroujeny,Brian Mark,Kai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: StealthInk is a multi-bit watermarking scheme for LLMs that embeds provenance data without altering text distribution, enabling traceability without API access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods either distort text distribution or only support zero-bit detection, lacking identification capabilities.

Method: StealthInk embeds multi-bit information (e.g., userID, TimeStamp) while preserving text distribution and derives a token count bound for detection.

Result: Empirical evaluations show StealthInk is stealthy, detectable, and resilient across tasks.

Conclusion: StealthInk is an effective solution for LLM watermarking, balancing traceability and text quality.

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the risks of model stealing attacks in LLMs, evaluates watermarking techniques, and highlights their limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs poses risks like intellectual property violations and misuse, especially through model stealing attacks. Watermarking is a potential solution, but its effectiveness and deployment status are unclear.

Method: The study systematizes watermarks in LLMs by creating a taxonomy, proposing an IP classifier, analyzing limitations, and discussing challenges.

Result: Experiments show watermarks have potential but negatively impact model utility and downstream tasks, limiting real-world application.

Conclusion: Practical watermark solutions tailored for LLMs are needed to address deployment challenges and enhance security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has neglected the security risks in LLM-generated code, prompting the need for a dedicated benchmark and evaluation framework.

Method: The study uses a dataset of common software scenarios and vulnerability types, combining static application security testing (SAST) and LLM-based judging for evaluation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows notable deficiencies in LLMs' ability to produce secure code.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges and provide insights for improving secure code generation in LLMs, with data and code to be released.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated

Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we
reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free

### [231] [To Protect the LLM Agent Against the Prompt Injection Attack with Polymorphic Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05739)
*Zhilong Wang,Neha Nagaraja,Lan Zhang,Hayretdin Bahsi,Pawan Patil,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PPA is a lightweight defense against prompt injection in LLM agents by dynamically varying system prompt structures, ensuring security without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and current defenses are either cumbersome or ineffective.

Method: Proposes Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which dynamically changes system prompt structures to prevent attackers from predicting them.

Result: PPA effectively defends against prompt injection with minimal overhead, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: PPA offers a practical and efficient solution to enhance LLM agent security against prompt injection.

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

*Ruining Sun,Hongsheng Hu,Wei Luo,Zhaoxi Zhang,Yanjun Zhang,Haizhuan Yuan,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in encoder models, introduces a new attack method (LpLA), and highlights the trade-off between model performance and data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate privacy threats from membership inference attacks (MIAs) in contrastive learning frameworks and propose a solution.

Method: Proposes the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack (LpLA), leveraging p-norm statistics of feature vectors for membership inference.

Result: LpLA outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, especially with limited knowledge and queries.

Conclusion: The study reveals privacy risks in contrastive learning and emphasizes balancing model utility with data privacy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our

### [233] [Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)
*Yuan Xun,Siyuan Liang,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Instruction Tuning, a defense framework for large visual language models (LVLMs) against stealthy backdoor attacks, operating without modifying core model weights or requiring prior attack knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks during finetuning with contaminated data, and existing defenses are unsuitable for real-world constraints like frozen core parameters or unknown triggers.

Method: The proposed method finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding layers, using two regularizations: Input Diversity Regularization and Anomalous Activation Regularization.

Result: The framework reduces attack success rates to nearly zero on Flickr30k and MSCOCO datasets, with minimal training cost increase (<15%).

Conclusion: Robust Instruction Tuning effectively defends LVLMs against backdoor attacks without core model modifications or attack priors.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QA-HFL is a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning framework for handling heterogeneous image quality on mobile devices, achieving high accuracy and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of heterogeneous image quality and resource constraints in federated learning on mobile devices.

Method: Trains specialized local models for different quality levels, aggregates features with quality-weighted fusion, and incorporates differential privacy.

Result: Achieves 92.31% accuracy on MNIST, outperforms FedRolex (86.42%), and maintains 30.77% accuracy under privacy constraints. Low-end devices contribute significantly (63.5%).

Conclusion: QA-HFL effectively balances accuracy, privacy, and efficiency, outperforming baselines under various conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

### [235] [Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)
*Haowei Wang,Rupeng Zhang,Junjie Wang,Mingyang Li,Yuekai Huang,Dandan Wang,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Joint-GCG is a framework unifying gradient-based attacks on RAG systems, improving attack success rates by up to 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks, but existing methods treat retrieval and generation as separate, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Joint-GCG aligns embedding spaces, synchronizes token-level gradients, and balances attacking objectives dynamically.

Result: Achieves up to 25% higher attack success rate and shows strong transferability to unseen models.

Conclusion: Joint-GCG reshapes understanding of RAG vulnerabilities by unifying attacks across retrieval and generation stages.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes using sentiment analysis in LMS to enhance online education by interpreting student feedback beyond verbal cues, employing a deep neural network model for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to online learning during Covid-19 reduced non-verbal communication, diminishing educational efficacy. This research aims to bridge the gap by analyzing student feedback sentiment.

Method: The study involves data preparation, feature selection, and a deep neural network model (word embedding, LSTM, attention) compared to logistic regression.

Result: The model aims to outperform logistic regression in interpreting student feedback, providing emotional context to improve online education.

Conclusion: Integrating sentiment analysis into LMS can enhance student-teacher communication and improve online learning quality.

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A systematic review explores the use of scenario building in computer science, focusing on its applications in AI and potential gaps like inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scenario building is used in computer science and identify unexplored opportunities, especially in enhancing inclusivity.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of 59 papers from the last decade, analyzing rationale and participatory elements.

Result: Reveals current applications of scenario building in computing and highlights gaps, such as participatory approaches.

Conclusion: Scenario building is valuable in computer science, but more inclusive and participatory methods could further enrich the field.

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

*Mayar Elfares,Pascal Reisert,Ralf Küsters,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: QualitEye is a method for verifying image-based gaze data quality, addressing privacy concerns and enabling collaboration in gaze-based applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in ensuring data quality and privacy in large-scale gaze data collection motivate the development of QualitEye.

Method: QualitEye uses a semantic representation of eye images for verification, supporting both public and privacy-preserving data exchange.

Result: High verification performance on MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets with minimal runtime overhead in privacy-preserving settings.

Conclusion: QualitEye advances gaze analysis by integrating machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: WoundAIssist is an AI-driven mobile app for telemedical wound care, enabling home monitoring and remote physician engagement, with high usability and favorable AI perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of chronic wound care, such as resource intensity and strain on patients and healthcare professionals, by leveraging telehealth and AI.

Method: Developed a patient-centered mobile app with on-device wound segmentation via deep learning, iterative user-centered design, and usability studies with patients and dermatologists.

Result: The app showed excellent usability, good quality, and positive reception of AI-driven wound recognition, bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers.

Conclusion: WoundAIssist is a successful telehealth solution, with design insights applicable to other remote patient monitoring tools.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between in-class learning and individualized assessment by leveraging AI-generated characters in SBA.

Method: Mixed-method study with 56 high schoolers, using Likert scale responses and PLS-SEM to analyze trust, social presence, and effectiveness.

Result: Learners' trust influenced social presence, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis identified trust factors like material credibility and learning goal alignment.

Conclusion: AI characters in SBA can foster competency development, with trust and social presence being key to their adoption and effectiveness.

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address older adults' reservations about emerging tech and provide tailored GenAI literacy support.

Method: Mixed methods approach with chatbot Litti, evaluating quantitative and qualitative impacts on AI literacy.

Result: Quantitative data showed non-significant improvement, but qualitative data revealed interest in learning and diverse familiarity levels. Litti didn't boost trust or safety perceptions.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges and opportunities in designing AI literacy programs for older adults.

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

TL;DR: ScaleRTL is a reasoning LLM for RTL coding that addresses data scarcity and test-time scaling limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs for RTL coding lack high-quality training data and reasoning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ScaleRTL curates a large dataset of reasoning traces (3.5B tokens) and fine-tunes a model, enhancing performance with test-time self-correction.

Result: ScaleRTL outperforms 18 baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Conclusion: ScaleRTL demonstrates the potential of reasoning LLMs for RTL coding by overcoming data and scaling challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High complexity and low readability in deployment environments make traditional MAS design methods costly or unsafe.

Method: AOMEA integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with an organizational model to suggest MAS organizational specifications.

Result: AOMEA provides a structured approach to ease MAS organization design, addressing complexity and safety concerns.

Conclusion: AOMEA offers a novel solution to improve MAS engineering by leveraging MARL and organizational modeling.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

TL;DR: T2MIR introduces token- and task-wise MoE layers to address multi-modality and task diversity in in-context RL, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in ICRL include multi-modality of data and task heterogeneity, which T2MIR aims to solve.

Method: T2MIR replaces feedforward layers with token-wise and task-wise MoE, using contrastive learning for task-wise routing.

Result: T2MIR enhances in-context learning and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: T2MIR advances ICRL with a scalable MoE-based architecture, bridging gaps with language/vision achievements.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

TL;DR: MTPNet is a novel framework for activity cliff prediction using multi-grained protein semantic conditions, outperforming existing methods by 18.95% RMSE improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for activity cliff prediction are limited to single binding targets, restricting their applicability. MTPNet aims to incorporate molecule-protein interaction knowledge for better predictions.

Method: MTPNet uses Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS) and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance to dynamically optimize molecular representations.

Result: MTPNet achieves significant improvements, with an 18.95% average RMSE reduction on 30 datasets.

Conclusion: MTPNet effectively captures interaction details and accelerates compound optimization, setting a new benchmark for activity cliff prediction.

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

Method: Uses a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy and an LLM-driven "linguistic compass" for clinically plausible sampling, combining diffusion models with language models.

Result: Outperforms baselines on ADNI and AIBL cohorts, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

Conclusion: MCI-Diff achieves real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance by synthesizing plausible future sMRI representations.

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

*Yuxuan Yue,Zukang Xu,Zhihang Yuan,Dawei Yang,Jianglong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCDVQ, a novel VQ framework, decouples and quantizes vector directions and magnitudes separately, improving accuracy for highly compressed LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the sensitivity of vector directions to quantization in LLMs, which current VQ methods overlook due to coupled quantization and Euclidean distance metrics.

Method: Proposes PCDVQ with Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD) for independent quantization of directions and magnitudes, and Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC) for optimized codebooks.

Result: PCDVQ achieves at least 1.5% higher zero-shot accuracy than baselines at 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: PCDVQ provides an effective solution for accurate and highly compressed LLMs, setting a new paradigm in VQ methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

*Zikang Liu,Tongtian Yue,Yepeng Tang,Longteng Guo,Junxian Cai,Qingbin Liu,Xi Chen,Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper optimizes GRPO by eliminating redundant prefix computations, maintaining performance while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's computational inefficiency with long shared prefixes limits scalability.

Method: Uses Shared-Prefix Forward to restructure self-attention, encoding prefixes once.

Result: Training-equivalent to GRPO, reduces computational cost, and maintains performance.

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper is a scalable, plug-and-play solution for GRPO, enabling larger group sizes.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now
available at https://github.com/johncaged/PrefixGrouper

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces lip-rcp, a method using Lipschitz-bounded networks to efficiently compute robust conformal prediction (CP) sets, outperforming existing methods in set size and computational efficiency. It also analyzes vanilla CP under attack, providing new worst-case coverage bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical CP lacks robustness under adversarial attacks, and existing robust CP methods are impractical for large-scale problems due to computational demands or overly large prediction sets.

Method: The proposed lip-rcp method leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to estimate robust CP sets efficiently, combined with 1-Lipschitz robust networks. It also analyzes vanilla CP under attack, deriving worst-case coverage bounds.

Result: lip-rcp outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robust CP set size and computational efficiency, particularly in medium and large-scale scenarios like ImageNet. New worst-case coverage bounds for vanilla CP are also derived.

Conclusion: The lip-rcp method offers a practical and efficient solution for robust CP, bridging the gap between robustness and computational feasibility, while also enhancing understanding of vanilla CP under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

TL;DR: Proposes an embedded system for reusable package monitoring using a deep learning model on accelerometer data, achieving high precision and reduced power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for long-lasting, efficient package monitoring to improve operational efficiency and ecological sustainability.

Method: Uses a 1D CNN for classifying accelerometer data, with data augmentation (SMOTE and ADASYN) and model compression techniques.

Result: Achieves 94.54% and 95.83% precision for two classes, reduces model size by 4x, and operates at 316 mW power consumption.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for long-term industrial use.

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

*Tongda Sun,Chen Yin,Huailiang Zheng,Yining Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised method constructs dynamic health indicators (HI) for rolling bearings, capturing temporal dependencies and degradation trends without expert knowledge, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HI construction methods rely on expert knowledge and fail to capture dynamic degradation information, limiting their effectiveness for prognostics.

Method: An unsupervised framework uses a skip-connection-based autoencoder for degradation feature extraction and an HI-generating module with temporal dependence modeling.

Result: The proposed dynamic HI outperforms comparison methods in degradation trend representation and prognostic tasks on bearing lifecycle datasets.

Conclusion: The dynamic HI effectively models degradation processes and improves prognostics, demonstrating superiority over traditional methods.

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

TL;DR: UniPTMs is a unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction, addressing cross-modal feature fusion and domain generalization with innovative architectures like BGCA and LDFN, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models lack cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization for PTM prediction.

Method: Proposes UniPTMs with a 'Master-Slave' dual-path architecture, BGCA for high-dimensional integration, LDFN for feature recalibration, MACP for local patterns, BHGFN for multi-level fusion, and HDWF for multimodal aggregation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models by 3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP across five PTM types, with a lightweight variant (UniPTMs-mini).

Conclusion: UniPTMs advances PTM prediction by unifying multi-type analysis and optimizing feature fusion, offering a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DoSAC is a causal RL method addressing hidden confounders by estimating interventional policies via backdoor adjustment, outperforming baselines in confounded settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden confounders in RL bias policy learning, leading to suboptimal behavior. Existing methods ignore this, relying on statistical associations rather than causal effects.

Method: DoSAC extends SAC with causal intervention estimation. It uses a Backdoor Reconstructor to infer pseudo-past variables for backdoor adjustment, integrating this into a soft actor-critic framework.

Result: Empirical results show DoSAC outperforms baselines in confounded settings, improving robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Conclusion: DoSAC effectively addresses hidden confounding in RL, offering a principled solution for learning reliable policies from observational data.

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

*Andrei Mircea,Supriyo Chakraborty,Nima Chitsazan,Irina Rish,Ekaterina Lobacheva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling mitigates loss deceleration in language models by reducing its occurrence and improving post-deceleration loss rates, attributed to zero-sum learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaling improves language models, focusing on training dynamics and loss deceleration.

Method: Analyze loss deceleration and zero-sum learning (ZSL) in language models, examining scaling effects on training dynamics.

Result: Scaling decreases loss deceleration occurrence and improves post-deceleration loss rates, with ZSL identified as a bottleneck.

Conclusion: Loss deceleration and ZSL offer insights into training dynamics, suggesting potential improvements independent of model scale.

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

TL;DR: Zeroth-order methods favor solutions with small trace of Hessian, distinguishing sharp and flat minima, supported by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding implicit regularization in zeroth-order optimization, which is widely used in machine learning but lacks fine-grained characterization.

Method: Analyze zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator, focusing on trace of Hessian to identify flat minima.

Result: Zeroth-order optimization converges to approximate flat minima for convex and smooth functions, with experimental validation.

Conclusion: Zeroth-order methods implicitly prefer flat minima, providing theoretical and practical insights for applications like black-box attacks and model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework for uncertainty quantification in generative AI models using finite queries, optimizing coverage, query budget, and informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is critical for deploying generative AI models safely, especially in high-stakes applications, but classical conformal prediction methods are limited to structured outputs.

Method: CPQ leverages the missing mass problem in statistics, using novel estimators for the decay rate and missing mass to define optimal query policies and mappings for prediction sets.

Result: Experiments on open-ended tasks and LLMs demonstrate CPQ's applicability and superiority in producing more informative prediction sets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CPQ effectively addresses the trade-offs in uncertainty quantification for black-box generative models, offering a practical and principled solution.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: TimeMCL is an efficient method for forecasting diverse time series futures.

Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)

TL;DR: Ravan, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method, improves federated fine-tuning of LLMs by balancing parameter efficiency and model expressivity, outperforming prior methods by 2-8% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging edge-device data for LLMs is challenging due to privacy and resource constraints. Federated learning (FL) with parameter-efficient methods like LoRA is promising but suffers from accuracy degradation due to data and computational heterogeneity.

Method: Ravan reparameterizes weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads, training only core matrices and lightweight scaling factors to focus optimization on useful heads without increasing communication costs.

Result: Ravan improves test accuracy by 2-8% over prior parameter-efficient baselines on vision and language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Ravan is a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning of LLMs, addressing limitations of existing LoRA-based methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and open-endedness in decentralized agentic systems by enabling autonomous knowledge sharing and reuse among agents.

Method: Combines modular policy composition, cosine similarity estimation via Wasserstein embeddings, and asynchronous communication for knowledge integration.

Result: MOSAIC outperforms isolated learners in sample efficiency and solves harder tasks, with emergent ideal task curricula.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning in agentic systems enhances individual and collective performance, supporting continuous evolution.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes methods to adapt conformal prediction for subpopulation shifts, ensuring valid coverage without needing subpopulation structure knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction fails under distribution shifts, especially subpopulation shifts, where test data has unknown mixtures of subpopulations.

Method: New algorithms that adapt conformal prediction to subpopulation shifts, scalable to high-dimensional settings.

Result: Methods maintain coverage and control risk in vision and language tasks, outperforming standard conformal prediction.

Conclusion: Effective solution for reliable uncertainty quantification under subpopulation shifts.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

TL;DR: CoFrNet, a novel neural architecture inspired by continued fractions, offers efficient training, interpretability, and universal approximation properties, outperforming or matching other models on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretable neural architectures by leveraging the properties of continued fractions for both performance and transparency.

Method: Introduces CoFrNet, a neural architecture based on continued fractions, with proofs of universal approximation and experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: CoFrNets achieve accurate modeling, feature attribution, and higher-order term estimation, performing comparably or better than interpretable models and MLPs on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: CoFrNets combine interpretability and representational power, offering a promising direction for building transparent neural architectures.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the free-energy foundations of inverse folding models for protein stability prediction, identifying limitations in current methods and proposing improvements for better zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between inverse folding models' amino acid preferences and thermodynamic stability principles, enhancing theoretical understanding and practical prediction accuracy.

Method: Derives the free-energy foundations of inverse folding models, critiques likelihood ratios as simplistic, and suggests alternative approaches for stability estimation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in zero-shot stability prediction using simpler, refined methods.

Conclusion: Understanding the free-energy basis of inverse folding models can lead to better stability predictions, with practical gains achievable through straightforward refinements.

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

TL;DR: A technique maps parameters from a large Transformer to a smaller, task-specific model, improving performance for specialized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Foundation Models (FMs) are computationally expensive and contain irrelevant knowledge for specific tasks.

Method: Mapping parameters of a large Transformer to a smaller, specialized model for task-specific performance.

Result: Generated smaller models outperform universal conditional models in image modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific parameter mapping enables efficient, high-performance specialized models.

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaxEnt RL enhances robustness but can mislead policy optimization in tasks needing precise control, affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the trade-off between robustness and optimality in MaxEnt RL for complex control tasks.

Method: Experiments on various control problems to demonstrate the misleading effect of entropy maximization.

Result: Shows that MaxEnt RL can fail in tasks requiring low-entropy policies despite its robustness benefits.

Conclusion: Balancing reward design and entropy maximization is crucial for effective performance in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

*Chao Zhang,Li Wang,Samson Lasaulce,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BAQ, a novel framework for nonuniform bitwidth allocation in LLM quantization using Hessian-based sensitivity metrics, outperforming GPTQ with up to 56x lower perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods use uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments, ignoring nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization noise.

Method: BAQ allocates bitwidths via convex optimization derived from Hessian proxy metrics, ensuring minimal layer-wise quantization loss.

Result: BAQ achieves up to 56x lower perplexity than GPTQ on LLMs (125M to 30B parameters) at the same bitwidth.

Conclusion: BAQ provides a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for LLM quantization, balancing loss minimization and complexity.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

*Antonia van Betteray,Matthias Rottmann,Karsten Kahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an O(N) complexity method for computing singular values of convolutional mappings using local Fourier analysis, improving efficiency over FFT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for computing singular values of convolutional mappings are resource-intensive, especially for large inputs and high channel counts.

Method: Uses local Fourier analysis to exploit shift invariance, achieving O(N) complexity.

Result: Demonstrates scalability and efficiency in computing singular values for high-dimensional convolutions.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for spectral analysis of convolutional mappings, enhancing applications like model compression and robustness.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) that eliminates explicit prompts by encoding context into model weights, enabling self-specialization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead from prompts in LLMs and improve adaptability by integrating context directly into the model.

Method: Proposes CGT, which maintains a contextual summary at each sequence position, updating weights dynamically based on context.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic tasks and benchmarks, with improved interpretability of contextual representations.

Conclusion: CGT offers a novel, efficient approach for adaptable language modeling by embedding context into the architecture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method, GP-MoLFormer-Sim, uses a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM) to guide molecular design by preserving similarity to target molecules, outperforming baselines when combined with a genetic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing molecules while preserving similarity to a target is crucial for drug discovery and chemical design, but existing methods often require training.

Method: Leverages CLM's contextual representations to estimate molecular similarity, adjusting autoregressive sampling to guide generations. Integrated with a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimization.

Result: GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA outperforms training-free baselines in molecular optimization benchmarks, including property optimization and drug design.

Conclusion: The method advances understanding of CLM generative mechanisms and offers a practical, training-free approach for molecular design.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQD automates behavioral descriptor generation for QD algorithms by embedding policy occupancy measures, eliminating the need for predefined descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-crafted behavioral descriptors limit exploration; AutoQD seeks to automate this process for more open-ended learning.

Method: Uses random Fourier features to approximate MMD between policy occupancy measures, creating embeddings for behavioral descriptors.

Result: Proves convergence to true MMD distances and demonstrates effectiveness in continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: AutoQD enables diverse policy discovery without domain-specific knowledge, advancing unsupervised RL and QD optimization.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for querying human experts efficiently in ML tasks, reducing query costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize human expert queries in ML predictions by leveraging pre-trained classifiers and modeling expert correlations.

Method: Develops a Bayesian framework with joint latent representation for expert correlation, enabling simulation-based inference and posterior distribution inference.

Result: Applied to medical classification and image datasets, showing significant reductions in expert query costs without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances expert input and model predictions, optimizing resource use in ML applications.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of AI is shifting from model-centric to data-centric approaches, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data for performance gains.

Method: The authors introduce the DSD dataset, comprising 10,610 high-quality images with annotations, and evaluate its impact on model performance against benchmarks.

Result: Quantitative improvements in model performance are documented, with the DSD dataset serving as a scalable foundation for AI development.

Conclusion: The DSD dataset represents a new standard for commercial image datasets, supporting robust AI development, with code and models made publicly available.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

TL;DR: ManGO is a diffusion-based framework for offline optimization that learns design-score interdependencies, outperforming existing methods across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing complex systems is challenging due to unknown rules and costly evaluations. Offline optimization often fails beyond training data.

Method: ManGO learns the design-score manifold holistically, unifying forward prediction and backward generation with derivative-free guidance and adaptive inference-time scaling.

Result: ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods in synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and engineering optimization.

Conclusion: ManGO's unified approach enables generalization beyond training data, making it a powerful tool for offline optimization.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

Motivation: To integrate the strengths of foundation models and federated learning for privacy-preserving, immersive XR experiences, addressing key challenges in the field.

Method: Introduces a modular architecture for FedFMs, focusing on coordination paradigms for training and aggregation, and codifies XR challenges under SHIFT dimensions.

Result: Outlines how FedFMs can address XR challenges, proposing metrics, dataset needs, and design tradeoffs for resource-aware implementation.

Conclusion: Aims to lay foundations for context-aware, privacy-preserving intelligence in next-gen XR systems.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the

TL;DR: Table-r1, a two-stage program-based table reasoning method for small language models, improves layout generalization and reasoning consistency, outperforming other SLM-based methods by 15% and nearing LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with table reasoning due to limited capacity compared to large LMs (LLMs). Program-based TR (P-TR) addresses numerical reasoning limitations of text-based TR (T-TR) but introduces layout heterogeneity and reasoning inconsistency challenges for SLMs.

Method: Table-r1 uses a two-stage approach: (1) Layout Transformation Inference for tabular layout generalization, and (2) a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization to enhance P-TR consistency, with dynamic fallback to T-TR.

Result: Table-r1 achieves at least 15% accuracy improvement over LLaMA-8B on four TR benchmarks, performing competitively with LLMs.

Conclusion: Table-r1 effectively bridges the gap between SLMs and LLMs in table reasoning, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and robustness.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), addressing policy generalization across changing action spaces. It proposes the Action-Adaptive Continual Learning (AACL) framework, which decouples policy from action spaces and adaptively fine-tunes representations. A benchmark validates AACL's superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CL methods assume static agent capabilities, which is unrealistic. The paper addresses the challenge of policy generalization in dynamic action spaces.

Method: Proposes AACL, which builds an action representation space and adaptively fine-tunes encoders-decoders for new action spaces, balancing stability and plasticity.

Result: AACL outperforms existing methods in generalizing policies across action spaces, validated by a benchmark of three environments.

Conclusion: The AACL framework effectively addresses CL-DC, demonstrating superior policy generalization in dynamic action spaces.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of how DQN improvements interact, especially multi-step and ensemble methods, motivates the development of EEDQN to stabilize performance.

Method: EEDQN integrates ensembles with elastic step updates, tested against standard and ensemble DQN variants on MinAtar environments.

Result: EEDQN achieves robust performance, outperforming baselines and matching/exceeding state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs in most MinAtar environments.

Conclusion: Systematically combining algorithmic improvements (ensembles and multi-step methods) can yield substantial gains in deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when

*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Zhonghao He,Tejasveer Chugh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) create an echo chamber effect by reinforcing human beliefs through a feedback loop, leading to reduced diversity and potential lock-in of false beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of the feedback loop between LLMs and human users on belief diversity and the entrenchment of false beliefs.

Method: Formalizes the hypothesis and tests it using agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data.

Result: Analysis shows sudden, sustained drops in diversity after new GPT releases, supporting the feedback loop hypothesis.

Conclusion: The feedback loop between LLMs and humans can entrench existing beliefs, reducing diversity and potentially locking in false beliefs.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

### [278] [Grokking Beyond the Euclidean Norm of Model Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05718)
*Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo,Guillaume Dumas,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking, delayed generalization after overfitting, can be induced by regularization (explicit or implicit). Over-parameterization enables grokking without explicit regularization, and data selection can amplify it. The ℓ₂ norm isn't a reliable proxy for generalization under certain regularizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how regularization and over-parameterization induce grokking, extending prior work on weight decay.

Method: Analyze gradient descent with small non-zero regularization (e.g., ℓ₁ or nuclear norm) and over-parameterization. Test ℓ₂ norm's reliability and data selection's impact.

Result: Grokking occurs with regularization or over-parameterization. ℓ₂ norm isn't always reliable for generalization. Data selection amplifies grokking.

Conclusion: Regularization and over-parameterization induce grokking, with data selection further enhancing it. ℓ₂ norm's role in generalization is context-dependent.

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

*Itai Gat,Neta Shaul,Uriel Singer,Yaron Lipman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPT improves autoregressive models by resampling previous tokens to reduce error accumulation, boosting performance on reasoning and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from fixed left-to-right token generation, leading to error accumulation.

Method: Proposes Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT), which revisits and replaces tokens in a window of past text.

Result: Fine-tuning with RPT improved a pretrained model by ~10% on reasoning and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPT effectively reduces error accumulation without compromising model speed or quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

*Dumindu Tissera,Omar Awadallah,Muhammad Umair Danish,Ayan Sadhu,Katarina Grolinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned loss function for multi-label classification (MLC) to handle datasets with large negative data, improving performance without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large proportions of negative data in MLC datasets can overwhelm learning and hinder accurate classification of positive instances, a common issue in applications like defect detection and healthcare diagnosis.

Method: The authors derive a likelihood of any class being present using a normalized weighted geometric mean of predicted probabilities and introduce a regularization parameter to balance absent class contributions.

Result: Experiments on SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14 show performance gains up to 6.01% in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function enhances MLC performance by improving awareness of implicit positive instances, without extra parameters or computational cost.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

### [281] [Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift across Evolving Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05736)
*En Yu,Jie Lu,Guangquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GILCD and CSFA to address joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in non-stationary data streams, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited supervision and uncertainty in non-stationary data streams.

Method: Proposes CSFA with prototype calibration and RSGS minimization for stable adaptation, combining sharpness-aware optimization and surrogate gap minimization.

Result: CSFA shows superior performance in adapting to evolving semantics and distributions, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CSFA provides a robust framework for open-world streaming scenarios, addressing concept drift and label space evolution effectively.

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [282] [Efficient Online RFT with Plug-and-Play LLM Judges: Unlocking State-of-the-Art Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05748)
*Rudransh Agnihotri,Ananya Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight method using a frozen 7B LLM with a JSON rubric and rank-16 LoRA adapter outperforms large reward models, achieving 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench and 92% on GSM-8K, while being cost-effective and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and inefficiency of traditional reward-model training in RLHF pipelines by proposing a simpler, plug-and-play solution.

Method: Augment a frozen 7B LLM with a JSON rubric and a rank-16 LoRA adapter (0.8% of parameters) to replace heavyweight reward models. Use in-context demonstrations and LoRA for performance.

Result: Achieves 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench and 92% on GSM-8K, outperforming larger models. LoRA improves safety and adversarial performance. Interpretability scores 9/10 with human-like explanations.

Conclusion: The method is cost-effective, transparent, and removes the need for offline training, setting new benchmarks for RLHF.

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

*Zhongying Wang,Thoai D. Ngo,Hamidreza Zoraghein,Benjamin Lucas,Morteza Karimzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel LSTM framework with a spatiotemporal feature (SPH) improves COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting, outperforming existing models during variant surges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed gaps in hospitalization forecasting, especially during variant surges, necessitating more accurate and timely models.

Method: The study introduces a parallel LSTM architecture with SPH, a feature derived from Facebook's Social Connectedness Index, and uses multi-horizon ensembling.

Result: The model outperformed COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models by significant margins during Delta and Omicron surges, with SPH proving highly predictive.

Conclusion: The research advances hospitalization forecasting and highlights the value of spatiotemporal features like SPH in infectious disease modeling.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

*Yang Li,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowOE, an imitation learning framework using flow matching models, outperforms traditional optimal execution strategies by dynamically adapting to market conditions and refining expert actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static strategies like Almgren-Chriss are suboptimal in dynamic markets, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: FlowOE learns from diverse expert strategies, uses a refining loss function to improve actions, and applies flow matching models for optimal execution.

Result: Empirical tests show FlowOE surpasses expert models and benchmarks, yielding higher profits with lower risk.

Conclusion: FlowOE demonstrates practical potential for adaptive optimal execution in dynamic financial markets.

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares PE and PH for GNNs, showing neither is more expressive than the other, and introduces PiPE, a method outperforming both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of GNNs in exploiting structural information by comparing PE and PH.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PE and PH, followed by the development of PiPE, a learnable method combining their strengths.

Result: PiPE is provably more expressive than PE and PH, showing strong performance in tasks like molecule prediction and graph classification.

Conclusion: PiPE advances graph representation learning by combining the strengths of PE and PH, with practical benefits demonstrated across tasks.

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper investigates loss functions in neural architecture search (NAS) performance predictors, categorizing them into regression, ranking, and weighted types, and evaluates their effectiveness across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of thorough investigation into the effectiveness and characteristics of loss functions in NAS performance predictors, which are crucial for reducing evaluation costs.

Method: The study categorizes loss functions into three types (regression, ranking, weighted) and evaluates eight of them using NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces.

Result: Specific categories of loss functions can be combined to enhance predictor-based NAS, and practical guidance for selecting loss functions is provided.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for developing loss functions in NAS performance predictors, aiding the NAS community in optimizing predictor-based methods.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for data attribution in generative models by learning parameter importance weights, improving accuracy and enabling fine-grained insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring layer-specific information contributions. The goal is to adapt attribution to model structure for better accuracy.

Method: Proposes learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, without labeled data, to capture how training examples influence specific semantic aspects of outputs.

Result: Improves attribution accuracy in diffusion models and provides detailed insights into how outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: The method enhances attribution by adapting to model structure, offering better accuracy and granularity in understanding training data influence.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

TL;DR: C-EDL improves adversarial and OOD robustness in deep learning by quantifying representational disagreement without retraining, outperforming EDL variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models need reliable uncertainty quantification for high-stakes applications, but EDL is vulnerable to adversarial inputs.

Method: C-EDL uses task-preserving transformations and representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates.

Result: C-EDL reduces OOD coverage by up to 55% and adversarial coverage by up to 90%, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: C-EDL is a lightweight, effective solution for enhancing robustness in uncertainty-aware deep learning.

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack

TL;DR: A test-time optimization method improves uncertainty estimation by addressing noisy classifier weights, enhancing reliability and performance in risk-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques like dropout fail to clearly distinguish reliable predictions due to noisy classifier weights.

Method: Proposes a novel test-time optimization method to account for noise impact, producing more reliable confidence estimates.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in AUSE and AURC metrics, effectively identifies distribution discrepancies, and differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The method enhances uncertainty estimation reliability and provides insights into CNN and ViT classifier differences.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

*Luka Hobor,Mario Brcic,Lidija Polutnik,Ante Kapetanovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates forecasting models for retail sales, comparing tree-based ensembles and neural networks, finding tree-based models more effective for accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for retail planning to avoid costs from overestimation or lost sales from underestimation, providing a competitive edge.

Method: The study assesses tree-based ensembles (XGBoost, LightGBM) and neural networks (N-BEATS, NHITS, Temporal Fusion Transformer) on a high-resolution retail dataset, addressing issues like intermittent demand and missing values.

Result: Tree-based models, especially with localized strategies and non-imputed data, outperform neural networks in accuracy and efficiency, while neural models benefit from advanced imputation but struggle with retail data irregularities.

Conclusion: Localized tree-based models are superior for retail forecasting, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing and model selection for optimal performance.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

*Motoki Omura,Kazuki Ota,Takayuki Osa,Yusuke Mukuta,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks for continuous actions accelerates learning but causes overestimation bias. An annealing method mitigates this, improving performance in RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the low sample efficiency of continuous-action RL algorithms by leveraging the Bellman optimality operator, which is typically used for discrete actions.

Method: Propose an annealing approach to transition from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, combined with TD3 and SAC.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in locomotion and manipulation tasks, showing improved performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The annealing method effectively balances learning acceleration and bias mitigation, enhancing actor-critic frameworks for continuous actions.

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

### [293] [Gradient Similarity Surgery in Multi-Task Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06130)
*Thomas Borsani,Andrea Rosani,Giuseppe Nicosia,Giuseppe Di Fatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method for multi-task deep learning, addressing conflicting gradients by using similarity-aware momentum to improve optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting gradients in multi-task learning hinder convergence, requiring methods to balance or adjust gradients for effective training.

Method: SAM-GS uses gradient magnitude similarity to equalize and modulate momentum, guiding optimization.

Result: Experiments show SAM-GS's effectiveness on synthetic problems and benchmarks, improving gradient aggregation.

Conclusion: SAM-GS enhances multi-task learning by regularizing gradient conflicts, optimizing the training process.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes long-range interactions in graph tasks, introduces a range measure for graph operators, and validates it with synthetic experiments to address the lack of robustness in empirical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open problem of long-range graph tasks lacks theoretical underpinning, prompting the need for a principled characterization.

Method: The authors formalize long-range interactions, introduce a range measure for graph operators, and validate it with synthetic experiments.

Result: The proposed range measure is validated and used to evaluate common tasks and architectures for their long-range capabilities.

Conclusion: The work advances the definition and addressing of the long-range problem in graphs, aiding future evaluation of datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMPED balances exploration and skill diversity in SBRL using gradient surgery and a skill selector, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SBRL methods struggle to optimize exploration and skill diversity simultaneously.

Method: AMPED uses gradient surgery for objective balance and a skill selector for task adaptation.

Result: AMPED surpasses SBRL baselines in benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMPED effectively harmonizes exploration and diversity for robust skill learning.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

*Mohammad Jalali,Bahar Dibaei Nia,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEC, a framework for interpretable comparison of feature embeddings by analyzing clustering mismatches, and offers a scalable, kernel-based solution with linear computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings focus on numerical performance, lacking interpretability. The need is to identify and analyze mismatches in clustering between embeddings.

Method: The SPEC framework compares embeddings by examining kernel matrices and using eigendecomposition of the difference matrix to detect clustering differences. It includes a scalable implementation and an optimization problem for alignment.

Result: SPEC successfully compares and aligns embeddings on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and MS-COCO, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Conclusion: SPEC provides an interpretable and scalable method for comparing and aligning feature embeddings, addressing gaps in current numerical-focused comparisons.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-LoRA (T2L) is a hypernetwork that generates LoRA adapters for Large Language Models (LLMs) based on natural language task descriptions, eliminating the need for expensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning for task-specific adaptation of foundation models is costly, time-consuming, and hyperparameter-sensitive. T2L aims to democratize model specialization with minimal compute.

Method: T2L is trained on 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters to generate task-specific LoRAs in a single forward pass, enabling efficient adaptation.

Result: T2L matches the performance of task-specific adapters on test sets and generalizes zero-shot to unseen tasks, compressing hundreds of LoRA instances.

Conclusion: T2L advances foundation model specialization by enabling language-based adaptation with low compute, making it accessible for diverse applications.

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

*Cheng-Long Wang,Qi Li,Zihang Xiang,Yinzhi Cao,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAM, a framework for assessing machine unlearning by measuring sample-level completeness, addressing limitations of existing methods like MIAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing data privacy concerns necessitate efficient machine unlearning methods, but current techniques like MIAs are resource-intensive and lack granularity.

Method: Proposes IAM, which interpolates the generalization-fitting behavior gap to quantify unlearning completeness, scalable with minimal resources.

Result: IAM performs well in binary tests and correlates highly for approximate unlearning, revealing risks of over/under-unlearning in existing systems.

Conclusion: IAM offers a scalable, efficient solution for unlearning inference, highlighting the need for better safeguards in approximate unlearning.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust and can be reverted easily. UNDO, a distillation-based method, improves robustness and efficiency, matching retraining performance at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods are fragile and reversible, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

Method: Proposes UNDO, a method combining unlearning, noise addition, and distillation to enhance robustness and scalability.

Result: UNDO achieves robustness comparable to retraining from scratch with significantly lower compute and data requirements.

Conclusion: UNDO provides a practical and efficient solution for robust unlearning, applicable to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

TL;DR: FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling) mitigates bias in eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs by normalizing weight matrices with fixed aspect ratios, improving model diagnosis and hyperparameter assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bias in estimating heavytailness metrics due to varying aspect ratios of weight matrices in eigenspectrum analysis.

Method: Proposes FARMS, which subsamples submatrices with fixed aspect ratios and measures their average ESD to reduce bias.

Result: FARMS improves eigenspectrum analysis accuracy and hyperparameter assignment, reducing perplexity in LLM pruning by 17.3%.

Conclusion: FARMS effectively mitigates aspect ratio bias, enhancing model diagnosis and optimization across diverse applications.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: The study evaluates student interactions with an AI-powered learning tool in engineering courses, finding it convenient but raising ethical concerns and mixed perceptions of instructional quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand student perceptions and interactions with AI tools in higher education for responsible adoption.

Method: Mixed-methods approach using surveys, system logs, and qualitative analysis of student-AI interactions.

Result: Students found the AI tool convenient but had ethical concerns and mixed views on its instructional quality.

Conclusion: Thoughtful integration and clear policies are needed to foster student trust and effective AI use in education.

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational tools often rely on costly, cloud-based or proprietary solutions, raising privacy and affordability issues, especially for regulated industries with limited budgets.

Method: The framework uses small (3B-7B parameters) LLMs, an interactive refinement loop, and an auxiliary verifier for safety. It employs RAG/CAG for factual accuracy and customization, deployed on-premises for privacy.

Result: The system, validated via a college physics pilot, shows small LLMs can provide robust, affordable, and safe educator support, matching larger models for targeted tasks.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered small LLMs offer practical, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving solutions for educators, with performance comparable to larger models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an

Motivation: To address the 'rich-get-richer' dynamic in scientific recommender systems, which stifles diversity and innovation by prioritizing high-profile papers.

Method: Proposes overhauling search platforms with user-specific calibration and suggests using word embeddings/LLMs to increase user autonomy.

Result: Highlights the need for platforms to balance popularity, recency, and relevance, fostering diverse perspectives.

Conclusion: Recommends designing systems that prioritize user autonomy to promote robust, dynamic information access aligned with scientific values.

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex patterns in physical systems is challenging due to obscured correlations from complexity and spatial inhomogeneity.

Method: Adjacent correlation analysis evaluates local correlations, representing them as vectors in phase space overlaid on Probability Density Function (PDF) plots.

Result: The method reveals regular patterns in correlation vectors, equivalent to dynamical systems' vector fields, enabling classification, prediction, and forecasting.

Conclusion: This approach advances the study of complex systems by efficiently extracting and representing local correlations, offering practical applications in various domains.

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse real-world data for human-centric tasks, especially in sports, limits computer vision performance. Synthetic datasets often lack diversity due to rigid asset libraries.

Method: Gen4D combines motion encoding, diffusion-based avatar generation, and human-aware background synthesis to create varied 4D animations. SportPAL is a synthetic dataset built using Gen4D.

Result: Gen4D produces photorealistic and diverse human sequences. SportPAL offers a scalable synthetic dataset for sports-related vision tasks.

Conclusion: Gen4D and SportPAL provide a practical, automated solution for generating synthetic datasets, eliminating the need for manual 3D modeling.

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

### [310] [ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05480)
*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ODEs to forecast dynamic 3D scenes beyond training time, outperforming existing methods in extrapolation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering systems fail at predicting future scenes due to time embedding limitations. ODE-GS aims to overcome this by decoupling time dependency and leveraging latent ODE dynamics.

Method: ODE-GS uses a frozen time-conditioned deformation model and a Transformer encoder to summarize past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state. A neural ODE governs its evolution, enabling future predictions.

Result: ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and reducing LPIPS by half compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Continuous-time latent dynamics are effective for photorealistic 3D scene prediction, as demonstrated by ODE-GS's superior performance.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

*Yuchao Zheng,Jianing Zhang,Guochen Ning,Hongen Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SurGSplat improves 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgery by refining 3D Gaussian Splatting with geometric constraints, enhancing accuracy and visual clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfM-based methods fail in endoscopic scenarios due to sparse features and inconsistent lighting, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: SurGSplat progressively refines 3D Gaussian Splatting using geometric constraints for detailed vascular and feature reconstruction.

Result: SurGSplat outperforms in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, offering high-fidelity surgical scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: SurGSplat is an efficient, high-fidelity solution for intraoperative navigation in challenging endoscopic environments.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

*Linxuan He,Qing-Shan Jia,Ang Li,Hongyan Sang,Ling Wang,Jiwen Lu,Tao Zhang,Jie Zhou,Yi Zhang,Yisen Wang,Peng Wei,Zhongyuan Wang,Henry X. Liu,Shuo Feng*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces provable probabilistic safety for embodied AI systems, addressing the impracticality of deterministic safety proofs by using statistical methods to ensure residual risk remains below a threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in embodied AI systems is challenging due to rare failures and complex environments, hindering large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains.

Method: The work proposes provable probabilistic safety, leveraging statistical methods to establish probabilistic safety boundaries instead of exhaustive deterministic proofs.

Result: This approach enables scalable deployment of embodied AI systems while allowing continuous refinement of safety guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, promoting safer large-scale adoption of embodied AI in critical applications.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

*David Palzer,Matthew Maciejewski,Eric Fosler-Lussier*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper extends the Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA) approach for speaker diarization by focusing on detailed speaker attributes and using conformers for better local dependency modeling, showing improved performance on the CALLHOME dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speaker diarization by moving beyond direct speaker modeling to detailed speaker attributes and enhancing architecture with conformers.

Method: Extends EDA with multi-stage intermediate representations for speaker attributes and replaces transformers with conformers.

Result: Improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements to EDA, focusing on detailed speaker attributes and conformers, yield better speaker diarization results.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

### [314] [Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05688)
*Keinichi Fujita,Shota Horiguchi,Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method for controlling voice impressions in zero-shot TTS using low-dimensional vectors and large language models, eliminating manual optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulating para-/non-linguistic information in speech to control perceived voice characteristics is challenging in zero-shot TTS.

Method: Utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent voice impression pairs and generates it via a large language model from natural language descriptions.

Result: Effective impression control demonstrated through objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The method successfully controls voice impressions and automates the process, removing the need for manual optimization.

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

*Zijian Yang,Minh-Nghia Phan,Ralf Schlüter,Hermann Ney*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how CTC implicitly learns a context-dependent internal language model (ILM) despite its label context independence assumption. It proposes novel ILM estimation methods using knowledge distillation and regularization, showing improved performance in cross-domain evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implicit context dependency in CTC's ILM and improve its performance, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Proposes context-dependent ILM estimation via knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical backing and introduces two KD regularization methods.

Result: Context-dependent ILMs outperform context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, with the proposed label-level KD method achieving over 13% relative improvement in word error rate.

Conclusion: CTC learns a context-dependent ILM, and the proposed KD-based methods effectively enhance its performance, particularly in cross-domain tasks.

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

*Jakaria Islam Emon,Kazi Tamanna Alam,Md. Abu Salek*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WhisQ is a multimodal architecture for MOS prediction in text-to-music systems, using co-attention and optimal transport for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenge of evaluating musical quality and text alignment in text-to-music systems.

Method: Uses Whisper Base for audio encoding and Qwen 3 for text encoding, with co-attention and optimal transport regularization.

Result: Achieves 7% and 14% improvements in Spearman correlation for OMQ and TA, respectively, on MusicEval Track-1.

Conclusion: Optimal transport regularization significantly enhances performance, highlighting the need for explicit cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

TL;DR: Noninvasive neural modulation in primates using visual perturbations achieves precise control of targeted neurons, validated by model predictions and biological results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of precise, noninvasive neural control without affecting nearby neurons, avoiding invasive techniques.

Method: Using visual perturbations on natural visual feeds to modulate neural activity in the primate ventral visual stream, tested on macaque IT neural populations.

Result: Strong modulation of targeted neural sites, with model predictions matching biological outcomes, and successful injection of experimenter-chosen neural patterns.

Conclusion: Machine-executable models can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered neural interventions at single-neuron resolution.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

### [318] [Enhancing Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimators for Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05391)
*Ambrose Emmett-Iwaniw,Nathan Kirk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved autoregressive model for predicting missing pixels in images, focusing on pixel patch selection and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image reconstruction by efficiently predicting unobserved parts of an image using autoregressive models, with a focus on pixel patch selection.

Method: A generalized and computationally efficient version of ConvNADE for real-valued and color images, tested with random and low-discrepancy pixel patches.

Result: Low-discrepancy pixel patches reduce test loss and yield more realistic reconstructions compared to random patches.

Conclusion: Optimal pixel selection (low-discrepancy) improves autoregressive model performance for image reconstruction.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A method using pix2pix to synthesize histological images from MSI for unimodal registration, improving MI and SSIM metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Registration of histology and MSI is challenging due to differing image processes and dimensionalities.

Method: Uses a pix2pix model to synthesize histological images from MSI for easier registration.

Result: Preliminary results show improved MI (+0.924) and SSIM (+0.419) over a baseline U-Net model.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses registration challenges between histology and MSI.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,

*Minglang Chen,Jie He,Caixu Xu,Bocheng Liang,Shengli Li,Guannan He,Xiongjie Tao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FPDANet, a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network, improves fetal ultrasound image classification by addressing ResNet's limitations with positional attention and multi-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet's unidirectional feature transfer and lack of contextual correlation are ineffective for fetal ultrasound images, which suffer from low contrast, high similarity, and noise.

Method: FPDANet introduces a positional attention mechanism (DAN) and a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) module to enhance feature representation and capture contextual dependencies.

Result: FPDANet achieved 91.05% (Top-1) and 100% (Top-5) classification accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: FPDANet outperforms ResNet in fetal ultrasound image classification by leveraging contextual and multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LinGuinE is an automated method for longitudinal lung tumour segmentation, improving Dice scores by over 20% on test datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few solutions exist for automated longitudinal tumour segmentation, which is crucial for tracking chemotherapy response in lung cancer.

Method: LinGuinE uses radiologist input to sample tumour points, propagates them via rigid registration, and employs a classifier to validate and segment tumours in new time points.

Result: LinGuinE improves Dice scores by over 20% (p<0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies on clinical and public datasets.

Conclusion: LinGuinE is effective for longitudinal tumour segmentation, works from any starting time point, and outperforms other setups.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

TL;DR: DermaCon-IN is a new dermatology dataset from South India with 5,450 clinical images, addressing gaps in AI diagnostics by capturing diverse skin tones and conditions. It benchmarks various AI models to improve interpretability and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI dermatology models lack diversity in datasets, missing regional and demographic variations. DermaCon-IN aims to fill this gap by providing a representative dataset from South India.

Method: The dataset includes 5,450 images from 3,000 patients, annotated by dermatologists using a hierarchical taxonomy. AI models like ResNet, ViT, and Concept Bottleneck Models are benchmarked.

Result: The dataset captures diverse dermatologic conditions and skin tones, providing baseline performance metrics for AI models.

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN offers a scalable, representative foundation for developing equitable and interpretable dermatology AI models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

*Tianyi Zhang,Shidong Pan,Zejun Zhang,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IaCGen, an LLM-based framework for generating deployable Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates, and DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating deployability. While initial LLM performance was poor, IaCGen improved success rates to over 90%, though challenges in user intent alignment and security remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IaC generation evaluations focus on syntactic correctness, ignoring deployability. This gap limits the practical utility of generated IaC templates.

Method: The authors propose IaCGen, a framework using iterative feedback to generate deployable IaC templates, and DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark with 153 real-world scenarios to evaluate syntax, deployment, user intent, and security.

Result: Initial LLM performance was low (26.8%-30.2% deployment success), but IaCGen improved it to over 90%. However, user intent alignment (25.2%) and security compliance (8.4%) remain challenges.

Conclusion: The work provides the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC generation, highlighting the need for further research in user intent and security.

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

*Zihan Wang,Siyao Liu,Yang Sun,Hongyan Li,Kai Shen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent system generates high-quality test cases for competitive programming, improving dataset accuracy and benefiting LLM reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test cases for competitive programming problems are scarce, yet crucial for accurate evaluation. Existing datasets lack quality test cases, necessitating a solution.

Method: An LLM-based agent system is developed to create high-quality test cases, applied to the CodeContests dataset to produce CodeContests+.

Result: CodeContests+ shows higher accuracy, especially in True Positive Rate (TPR), and improves LLM reinforcement learning outcomes.

Conclusion: The LLM-based test case generation system enhances dataset quality and evaluation accuracy, proving valuable for competitive programming and LLM training.

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Result: AI-generated test cases improved assessments, detecting errors in 67% of OJI 5th grade problems.

Conclusion: The method offers practical tools for educators to enhance assessments and reduce workload.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language
models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive
programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse
datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for
5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

*Jingyu Xiao,Ming Wang,Man Ho Lam,Yuxuan Wan,Junliang Liu,Yintong Huo,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DesignBench is a multi-framework, multi-task benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in front-end engineering, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by incorporating mainstream frameworks, iterative tasks, and multidimensional evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for UI code generation lack framework diversity, iterative task evaluation, and multidimensional analysis, limiting their practical relevance.

Method: DesignBench includes React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla HTML/CSS, evaluating generation, editing, and repair tasks across 900 webpage samples with varied topics, edit types, and issue categories.

Result: The benchmark reveals MLLMs' framework-specific limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under different conditions.

Conclusion: DesignBench provides critical insights for future research in automated front-end development, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

*Yangui Fang,Jing Peng,Xu Li,Yu Xi,Chengwei Zhang,Guohui Zhong,Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A text-only fine-tuning method for Speech LLMs improves domain adaptation in low-resource settings without requiring additional audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Speech LLMs to new domains is challenging due to scarce paired speech-text data.

Method: Proposes text-only fine-tuning using unpaired target-domain text and a real-time evaluation mechanism to preserve alignment.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning, improving generalization.

Conclusion: Text-only fine-tuning is effective for low-resource domain adaptation in ASR, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

### [330] [Audio-Aware Large Language Models as Judges for Speaking Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05984)
*Cheng-Han Chiang,Xiaofei Wang,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Radu Kopetz,Yao Qian,Zhendong Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Hung-yi Lee,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Audio-aware Large Language Models (ALLMs) as judges to assess speaking styles in speeches generated by Spoken Language Models (SLMs). It compares ALLM judges (GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro) with human evaluations, showing Gemini's agreement with humans is comparable to inter-human agreement. Results indicate ALLMs can effectively evaluate SLMs, though SLMs still need improvement in style control and dialogue naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage ALLMs for evaluating the speaking styles (e.g., emotion, pace, pitch) of speeches generated by SLMs, addressing the need for automated assessment tools.

Method: Four SLMs generate speeches for two tasks (voice style instruction following and role-playing). Human and ALLM judges (GPT-4o-audio, Gemini-2.5-pro) evaluate the SLMs' outputs, with results compared for agreement.

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro's evaluations align closely with human judges, comparable to inter-human agreement. ALLMs prove viable for judging SLMs, but SLMs (including GPT-4o-audio) lack precision in style control and dialogue naturalness.

Conclusion: ALLMs, especially Gemini-2.5-pro, can serve as reliable judges for SLM evaluations, though SLMs require further refinement in stylistic and natural dialogue generation.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CO-VADA is a debiasing method for SER systems that avoids model changes and demographic data by using voice conversion to alter biased samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias in SER systems caused by spurious correlations without requiring demographic annotations or model modifications.

Method: Identifies biased training samples, applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes, and generates augmented samples to diversify speaker variations.

Result: Improves fairness in SER systems by reducing reliance on biased patterns and focusing on emotion-relevant features.

Conclusion: CO-VADA is a scalable and practical solution for debiasing SER systems, compatible with various models and tools.

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Conclusion: The USM lays the groundwork for scalable and generalizable AI systems, offering a novel computational paradigm.

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep

TL;DR: A novel spiking neuron model, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, is proposed to enhance SNN performance and energy efficiency, achieving competitive results with ANNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag behind ANNs in tasks like image classification due to limited representational capacity. The goal is to improve SNN performance without significantly increasing energy consumption.

Method: The method combines Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire for integer activation during training and binary dynamics during inference, along with a range alignment strategy to address spike activation limitations.

Result: The method achieves 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 on COCO, surpassing previous SNNs by significant margins and matching/exceeding ANN performance with improved energy efficiency (6.3×).

Conclusion: The proposed spiking neuron model successfully bridges the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs while maintaining energy efficiency, making SNNs more viable for practical applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance
with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI poses security and ethical threats through realistic manipulated media. Existing DeepFake detection methods face reproducibility issues and dataset flaws, necessitating a deeper understanding of benchmarking challenges.

Method: The study examines benchmarking pillars (datasets, methods, evaluation) and introduces DeepSpeak v1. It proposes SIMBA, a simple multimodal baseline, and addresses audio shortcuts with a mitigation strategy. It also enhances evaluation on FakeAVCeleb.

Result: The paper provides insights into audio-video DeepFake detection challenges, introduces a new dataset and baseline model, and improves evaluation protocols. It also identifies and mitigates audio shortcuts.

Conclusion: The findings advance the field of audio-video DeepFake detection by addressing key benchmarking issues, offering practical solutions, and paving the way for future research.

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of
reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the
recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset.
Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces PnP, an optimization-free watermark forgery attack using regenerative diffusion models, posing a significant risk to current watermarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the vulnerability of watermarking in synthetic images by demonstrating an easy, universal forgery method.

Method: PnP (Plug-and-Plant) leverages regenerative diffusion models to extract and integrate watermarks without optimization, using watermarked latent and visual-textual context as priors.

Result: PnP achieves up to 100% detectability and user attribution while maintaining visual quality, tested across 24 scenarios.

Conclusion: PnP broadens forgery attack scope, challenging watermarking security and governance in synthetic data.

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

Motivation: To extend LE-ALC for reasoning in fuzzy formal contexts, addressing the need for many-valued logic in knowledge representation.

Method: Develops LE-FALC, a fuzzy version of LE-ALC, and provides tableaux algorithms for consistency checks in ABoxes and acyclic TBoxes.

Result: Polynomial-time decision procedure for LE-FALC ABoxes and exponential-time procedure for acyclic TBoxes.

Conclusion: LE-FALC effectively extends LE-ALC for fuzzy reasoning, with practical decision procedures for consistency checks.

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency
of LE-FALC with acyclic TBoxes by unraveling.

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm to translate feedforward neural networks with ReLU and truncated identity activations into piecewise linear regional representations, investigating their complexity and suitability for lattice/logical representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network interpretability by representing them as piecewise linear functions, enabling clearer understanding and further transformations like lattice/logical representations.

Method: An algorithm is developed to translate neural networks with ReLU (hidden layers) and truncated identity (output layer) activations into regional piecewise linear representations. The method's output complexity is empirically tested across varying network sizes.

Result: The algorithm successfully generates regional representations, and empirical analysis shows how their complexity scales with network size. The suitability of these representations for lattice/logical forms is also evaluated.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a viable path for interpretability by converting neural networks into piecewise linear representations, though further work may be needed to ensure they meet specific properties for lattice/logical transformations.

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.
