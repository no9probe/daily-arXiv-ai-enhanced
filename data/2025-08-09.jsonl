This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and\nfinancial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To\nremedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of\nthe widely-used BPE algorithm.

This\npaper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)\nallowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas\nframe rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our\nsolution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin\nNano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated\nby experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate\nthat the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR\nmethods in a plug \\& play manner to further enhance their performance."}

To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to\ngeneralize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.\nExtensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases\nthe number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder\ndatasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching\nDirection Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,\nachieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher."}

First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which\nensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients\nfrom sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient\ndecorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on\nloss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization\nby eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results\non various detection models, angles and distances show that our method\nsignificantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.\nFurthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need\nfor more robust system design."}

However, a fundamental\nquestion remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate\nmore knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that\nleverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize\nknowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively. Specifically, our \\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster\n(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and\npredicts enhanced weights with improved generalization.

Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo.

However, existing EEG feature\nselection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on\nemotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various\nchannels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection\nmodels for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,\na novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for\nmulti-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume\nconduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a\nshared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space\nacross diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this\nconsensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of\nmulti-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive\nchannel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of\ndifferent EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The\neffectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with\nmulti-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,\ncompared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG\nfeature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance\nacross six evaluation metrics."}

The genetic\naberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly\nguessing.
