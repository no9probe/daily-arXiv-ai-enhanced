This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study.

In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption.

This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning.

After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction.

However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly\nmodeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and\ngeneralizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios."}

Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique\nreference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited\nknowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.\nMoreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in\nacademic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose\nleveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,\ne.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we\nextract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review\nreports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,\nwhich are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a\ntext-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human\nand LLM knowledge.

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention\nrequires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units\nresult in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.
