While recent advances in\nlarge language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain\ninaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,\npre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we\nargue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,\nwhere AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than\nstatic datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,\nparticularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond\nstatic data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven\ndiscovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration\ninstead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework\ngrounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty\nfrom the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers\nto guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention.

We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs\ninto ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a\nlightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and\niterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and\nsemantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into\nsessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level\nlog evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on\nboth logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,\ndemonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate\nmapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics.

Specifically, we first apply\noperation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in\ntextual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided\nreinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own\nresponses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be\ninvoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal\nreasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while\nsignificantly reducing unnecessary visual operations.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision.

By leveraging scheduling strategies such\nas Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves\nresource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing\nresource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens.

This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining.

In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,\nwe question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and\nhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that\ndraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then\nboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena\ndatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative\nincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all\nfour rating systems studied.

To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap\nby fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our\nnovel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning\npairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model.

Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining.

On\none hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems\nthat require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning\n(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even\nafter reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as\nunder-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length\nappropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity\nand strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think\nRight with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method\nthat leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to\nidentify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates\ndifficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to\nallocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach\nimproves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking\ncompared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks\n(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute\naccuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%\ncompared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length\ndrop compared to the best RL baseline.

Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides\nfine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a\ncombination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression\nyields gains across diverse tasks."}

To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass.

Using diverse RL algorithms and model\nclasses, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it\nreveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL\nconsistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a\nthree-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity\njointly determine gains.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

By utilizing\nmultimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,\nenhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML\nsystem latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,\npower control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource\nmanagement. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization\nproblem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining\nblock coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which\nprovides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical\nconvergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss\nfunction.

Working in the spherical harmonic (SH)\ndomain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input\nmeasurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial\ncoherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude\nsmoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using\nboth perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics.\nExperiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial\nmargin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs."}

In this paper, we investigate an\nunderexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own\nrankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in\ngame-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative\nbecause authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth\nand long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale\nexperiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked\ntheir 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than\na year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as\nmany citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were\nespecially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150\ncitations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review\nscores in predicting future citation counts. Our results remained robust after\naccounting for confounders such as preprint posting time and self-citations.\nTogether, these findings demonstrate that authors' self-rankings provide a\nreliable and valuable complement to peer review for identifying and elevating\nhigh-impact research in AI."}

Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,\nachieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\\deg \\pm 4.80\\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\\deg\n\\pm 4.18\\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \\pm 0.15$)\nand the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \\pm 0.28$). The\nresults reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic\nassessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and\nsensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This\nstudy clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically\npromising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based\nestimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians\nseeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for\ntelehealth and remote patient monitoring."}

Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets.
