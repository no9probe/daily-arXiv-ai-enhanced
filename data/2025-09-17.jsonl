Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration).

This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data\nexhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label\ndependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.\nWhile most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label\nclassification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as\nmedical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address\nthis important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label\ndata with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a\ngeometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class\ncollapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class\nmeans form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we\npropose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn\nhigh-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure\napplicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain\nmultiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that\nextracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled\nclass-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which\nmitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data\ndistributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage\ncompact clustering in the latent feature space.

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,\nsynthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets\n(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale\nregression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a\nthresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440\nfor the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99\nrange.

We outline a methodology\ninvolving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep\nlearning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for\nmodel refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,\ngood generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication\nand training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases\nin future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,\nsetting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work\ncomes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations\nin agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that\nare hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide\na secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize\nsmart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data\nconfidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced\nmachine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of\nfarmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning."}

SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity.

The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive\nsampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through\ncomprehensive experimental evaluations.

We empirically\nevaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results\ndemonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a\nsingle attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often\nrequire multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs."}

To address these limitations, we propose\nActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through\nmulti-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is\nused for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively\npredicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and\noptimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL\nefficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail\nor likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.\nExperiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL\nbaselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training\nmethods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art\napproaches despite using a smaller model.

To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage\nreinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the\nperceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing\nadvantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform\ndataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using\ndistinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving\nthe model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual\nunderstanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning\nabilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we\nobtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual\nand reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior\nperformance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks."}

While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted.

This yields up to 10% higher\naccuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned\nSFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at\nconverting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla\nSFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast\nprocedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to\nconclude."}

However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is\ncomputationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this\npaper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for\ntemporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)\narchitecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy\nin videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our\narchitecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure\ntemporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction\nmodule that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally\nredundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.\nSecond, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the\nframe-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model."}

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."}
