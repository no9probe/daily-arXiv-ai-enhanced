Unlike prior\nmethods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study\nintroduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt\nscheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling\nstrategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different\ntasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across\ntasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating\nmechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between\nprompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible\nsharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective\ncenters on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning\nstrategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference\nand negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of\nsensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact\nof prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm\nthe advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and\nenhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt\nscheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language\nunderstanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate\nits applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and\ncross-domain adaptation."}

We introduce \\textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that\nconverts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes\n\\emph{nonparametric} prefix values \\(V(s)\\) by aggregating descendant outcomes.\nBuilt on P2T, we propose \\textbf{TEMPO} (\\emph{\\textbf{T}ree-\\textbf{E}stimated\n\\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization}), a\ncritic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO\nwith \\emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.\nAt non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO\nreduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit\nwithout a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,\nTEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and\nout-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and\nreaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time."}

We\ndefine: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of\nentities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed\nrelational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the\nevolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by\n$p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers\n$F_{\\alpha}(K) = { E \\in U \\mid S(E,K) \\ge \\alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of\nthe unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that\nproduces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative\ndefinition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a\nconcept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of\n$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field\nTheory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and\nconstructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks\nmutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or\neventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the\nevolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,\nculminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large\nlanguage models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition."}

In this\npaper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond\ntraditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.\nThrough this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are\npermitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of\ncontext, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM\nconform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach\nstreamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and\nreduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our\nempirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against\nthe most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business\ncommunications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly\nbetween users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach\nusing false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to\n0 in our experimental setting."}

The new method fuses motion\nmodeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the\nSpatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical\nrepresentation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by\nTransformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent\ndeformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers\ndemonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both\nregular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and\nbronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method\nsignificantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from\napproximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to\njust 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D\nvolume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at\nany respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional\nmethods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation\ntherapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment."}

Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on\nconfidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which\nutilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a\nsmall number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage\nthe diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular\ndistributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed\nnoise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby\ngenerating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively\navoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,\nsignificantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the\nmodel's performance in the target domain."}

Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling\nautomated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety\nsupervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this\ntask faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high\ncomputational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,\nwe propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a\nWindow Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism\n(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global\ncontextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM\nadaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature\nrepresentation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172\ndatasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,\nrespectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with\nbaseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an\neffective balance between computational efficiency and classification\nperformance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments."}

While recent advances have achieved remarkable\nprogress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or\ncross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain\nmodels tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models\noften rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress\nidentity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose\nan Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual\nsemantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,\nwe design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic\nAttribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an\nover-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while\nPCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative\nattribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization\nability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training\nStrategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)\nto rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update\nStream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the\npre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively\nfocuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting.

To address this, we propose a\npatch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller\npatches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the\nreduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that\nbalance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)\nlocal-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off\nbetween computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the\nadvantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,\nwe explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)\nintroducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a\ntwo-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our\nresults demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational\ncomplexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline\nprocessing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore\nmaking it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based\nsystems."}

Deception was\nneither the main driver nor the main impact vector of AI's use; instead, Indian\ncreators sought to persuade rather than to deceive, often making AI's use\nobvious in order to reduce legal and reputational risks, while Taiwan's\ndefenders saw deception as a subset of broader efforts to distort the\nprevalence of strategic narratives online. AI was useful and used, however, in\nproducing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in\nevading human and algorithmic detection. Security researchers should reconsider\nthreat models to clearly differentiate deepfakes from promotional and obvious\nuses, to complement and bolster the social factors that constrain misuse by\ninternal actors, and to counter efficiency gains globally."}

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from\nclean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under\nadverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT.
