Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named\nideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle\nmodel, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling."}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies.

Understanding the logical structure of an argument\nrefers to understanding the underlying \"reasons\" which make up the proof or\ndisproof of the premise - as a function of the \"logical atoms\" in the argument.\nWhile it has been shown that transformers can \"chain\" rules to derive simple\narguments, the challenge of articulating the \"reasons\" remains. Not only do\ncurrent approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,\nthey are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to\ntheoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules\ncannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest\naddressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation\n(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the\nargument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural\nlanguage argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules\nincorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and\neasy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that\ndepend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including\narbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive\ndiscussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and\nextract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular\nreasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation\nand extending the reasoning capabilities significantly."}

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals.

First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune\nusing only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\\% in Swahili. Third,\ndata quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully\ncurated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier\ncorpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results\nclarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated\ndatasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research."}

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies.

Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency.

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

This obstacle arises from the way models\ninherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in\nspurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,\ncurrent methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required\nto isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key\nmechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an\nenergy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance\nfor the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a\nweight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between\ndomain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their\ninterference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances\nrobustness by injecting structured perturbations.

To address this issue, we propose\na novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,\nMF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and\naggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To\nachieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow\nestimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and\ncorrect erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal\nconsistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances\nboth image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential\ncontent of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR\n(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of\nlow-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth\nimages, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,\nMF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,\nand LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an\naccuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and\nthe multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of\nablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms\nsignificantly contribute to these improvements."}

For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private\ninformation or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such\nincidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent\nfuture occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not\nsufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are\nlargely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but\npotentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or\nbrowser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting\nprocesses, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on\nsystems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that\ncan cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual\n(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user\nrequest). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which\nfactors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation\nand access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide\nrecommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)\nwhat information developers and deployers should retain and make available to\nincident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more\nagents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for\nmanaging risks."}

We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments."}

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs."}

This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories.

During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position).

To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that\nsignificantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving\nmemory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is\ngrounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.\nWhen applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer\ntraffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and\nlatency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline\n(conventional weight-stationary dataflow)."}

A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms\nthat leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the\nprediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each\nrequest.\n  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$, which\nschedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to\nprevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted\nlower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during\ninferencing.

However, real-world applications often involve\nmultiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints\nmay emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a\npre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but\nalso to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we\npropose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion\nLanguage Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:\nmolecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a\npre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure\nControl Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two\ndistinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM\nto inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively\nanchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further\nintroducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated\nmolecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and\nadaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement\nin molecular generation for drug discovery applications."}

To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition.

To address this issue, we propose\na novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,\nMF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and\naggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To\nachieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow\nestimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and\ncorrect erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal\nconsistency inherent in license plate image sequences.

To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator.
