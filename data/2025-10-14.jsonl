However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric\nproperties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,\nwhich require a collection of pixels to represent.

If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point.

It is important for evaluating the quality and\ndeceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of\ndeepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake\ngeneration process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new\ndirection by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands\nfor Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of\ndiverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores\nand textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a\ncomprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment\nmethods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly\nproposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included\nin this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and\nother related areas."}

However, while\noutcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the\nreasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models\nproduce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our\nexperiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard\nGRPO method yields only 79.7\\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps\nand the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and\nreasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning\n(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.\nAfter the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given\nquestion, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the\nsame reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a\nconsistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the\noriginal and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower\nreward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer\nmisalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such\nas option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning\nbenchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\\%\nand 1.5\\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the\nGRPO baseline."}

We develop a framework to identify this ability by\ndisentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information\ngames, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly\nanalyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new\ncontext-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current\nfrontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted\nreasoning depths.

As the day passes, the\nnumber of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news\nportals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular\nconspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and\nthe Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially\ncreated racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society,\nothers create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the\nburn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an\nattack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill\nGates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass\nvaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust\nissues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to\ndiscover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms.

That leads to a ``black box\",\nwhere users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical\nresults. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background\ninformation that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such\nhidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to\ndistinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore\nwhether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in\nsome situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it\nmore difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank\nbackground. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging.

Multi-modal\napproaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness\nbut are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time\napplications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an\nintermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D\ngeometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational\nefficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually\nreconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where\nthe loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,\nand 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial\nalignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative\nfeatures from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a\ncomputationally efficient manner.

These biases risk turning away potential\nstudents and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop\na University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering\nProgram-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential\nbiases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student\nqueries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance,\npersonalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful\nprompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide\nhigh-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76\nfor accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no\nstereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample\nsize and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of\nstudent queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings\nwill inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education,\noffering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities\nfaced by many underrepresented and first-generation college students."}

Recently,\nMamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models\n(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla\nMamba to MGR may not be optimal.

In addition,\nprevious methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To\novercome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba\n(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing\nlocal contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state\nfusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a\nmultiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed.

At the\nsame time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such\nknowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this\nstudy, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern\nmachine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach\ncombines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures\nfragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual\nchemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score\n(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction\nlabels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel\nthree-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global\nexploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive\naccuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a\nclinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort.

Previous methods recognize\ndiscontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which\nface challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide\nvariety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply\nexplore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid\ntagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our\nGapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps\nbetween entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance\ndiscontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an\nadditional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid\ntagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to\ncomprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span\nperspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine\nmechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of\neach span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes\ncriss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At\nthe inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each\nentity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all\nvalid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable\nadvantages in recognizing complex entity structures."}

We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query.

In this position paper, we argue that we\nmust stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey\npaper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for\nAI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and\ntransparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as\nDynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories\nthat blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend\nanalysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that\nsafeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to\nthe research community."}

Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate\nspeech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to\ndata-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to\naccount for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.\nRV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on\ndistinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework\nemploys reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the\ncontribution of each module for a given dataset.

Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly\nemerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of\nbetter data efficiency and free of the \"reversal curse\" in pre-training.\nHowever, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training\nphase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through\nfine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,\nevaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to\nprobe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that\narLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA\ngeneralization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order\nmatches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward\nand backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal\ngains.

However, existing approaches\ntypically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which\noften leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off\ncourse due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for\nsmaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we\nanalyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning\nand execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from\nincorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan\nAggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan\nexploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on\nthe token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them\ninto a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design\nin which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA\nmodule implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that\noutcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K\ntokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level\npreference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo\n(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields\nmore efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method\noutperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward\nRL baseline across multiple base models and tasks."}

Existing\nmethods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to\naddress this task, but they face following major problems: they usually\noverlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack\nexplicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in\nincomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we\npropose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual\nannotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly\nmodeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract\nby pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone\nis employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model\nthe different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.\nExtensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving\ntextual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex\nCAD drawings."}

However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,\nespecially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this\ntraditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.\nWhile such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical\nthreat: the phenomenon we term the \"survey paper DDoS attack\" to the research\ncommunity. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially\ncomprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey\nmanuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and\nerodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we\nmust stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey\npaper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for\nAI-assisted review writing.

This limitation restricts the model's ability to make\ninformed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new\nperspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely\nintertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the\nvehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.\nMotivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel\nend-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory\nplanning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,\nthen leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.\nTwo key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects\npredicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene\nmodeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and\ntrajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments\non the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data.

To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range\nfrom effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along\nwith the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve\nalarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different\nbenchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API\nservices). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that\nthese vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger\nalignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

A confidence-weighted\noptimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly\nenforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D\nreprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible\nregions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only\n9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.\nIt naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse\ninteractions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing\nmean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,\nand improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic\nfoot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of\nheavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically\nplausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.\nOur implementation is publicly available at https://yuxuan-xue.com/physic."}

Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging.

This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement\ncapabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without\nexternal inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the\nself-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based\non a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,\nany masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The\nframework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation\nability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like\nimage$\\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\\rightarrow$question.

To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an\noptimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the\ntraining process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This\nintegration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error\nwhile selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model\nsearches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important\nelements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed\napproach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy\nobtained by pruning with the model and with other methods.

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly\ntriggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,\npotentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor\nattacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on\nuntargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of\ntargeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor\nattacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such\nattacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant\ninference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It\nformulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve\nattack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal\nthat the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors\nsucceed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger\ndesign, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and\ninference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense\nagainst TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream\nto flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the\nvulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores\nthe need for more advanced defenses."}

This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium.

Our approach\napplies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale\nmodel to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer\n(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only\noutperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)\nacross several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale\nteacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled\nmodel exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to\nimage variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest\nthat the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and\nparameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for\ncancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden."}

Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%\naccuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing\na 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for\n100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond\n55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.\nZero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories\n(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare\nspecialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to\narchitectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per\nCorrect Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for\nGemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We\ndevelop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection\ndepends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget\nconstraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance\nmetrics."}

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision.

In addition, we applied\nelement-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and\nvalue and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention\nmechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated\nsuperior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial\nshapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%\nmean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%\nand 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in\ncar detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of\nvoxels being filtered out."}

This suggests that the RL\nfine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen\nexisting solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such\nsharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster\nexploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we\nintroduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat\ncommon open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling\nbudgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that\nlearn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated\nsampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and\nDeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school\nmath.

Our\nmain finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,\nrepresentation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden\nstates significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for\npost-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce.
