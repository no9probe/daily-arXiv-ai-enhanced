However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly.

Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small\nvolumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques for the purpose of moderation.

Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its\nanalysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited\ndatasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in\ngame-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with\ngame domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player\nbehaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention\nModel (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing\ntechnique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as \"anchors\" to help\nimprove model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach\nled to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial\nbehaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where\nlarge-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one\nof the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern\nWarfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness.

This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing\nnovel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first\naddress alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually\ncurated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines\ntraining data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web\nReconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes\ninstruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly\nimproving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.\nNext, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We\ndevelop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently\nintegrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages\nmeta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.\nFurthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a\nrefinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures\ntoken-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment\nacross QA and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt\nand varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into\nmany algorithms for gains across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIntent Factored Generation (IFG)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65f6\u4ec5\u505c\u7559\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u91cd\u590d\u65e0\u8da3\u3002", "method": "IFG\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u610f\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u6458\u8981\u6216\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86pass@k\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "IFG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during\npre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and\ncopyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn\nundesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,\nexisting methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,\ntrapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized\nconcept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment\nerasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by\nthe cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns\nthe boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial\nrelationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional\npreprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of\nirrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the\nglobal-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic\nrelationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively\nexpanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts.

In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length\nTraining (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to\nmatch the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs.

To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to\npredict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated\nand unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D\nscene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and\npredict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder.

Progress, however, rests on the premise\nthat benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that\nthe reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system\nconfiguration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can\nintroduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is\nespecially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in\nearly tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting\naccuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a\nreasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation\nin accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences\nin GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this\nvariability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under\nlimited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic\ninvestigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM\ninference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,\nsoftware, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs\ndiverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical\nfor reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices.

Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have\nshown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD\ndata with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to\naddress the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the\nlimitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training\ndistribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed\nsamples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in\nresponse to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that\ndynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,\nrefining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the\ndirection of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual\nspace, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on\nunintended directions in the principal space.

InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly\ninterleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous\nautomated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training\nnext-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of\nreliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,\nwe introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively\nassess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,\nimage quality, and image-text synergy.\n  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher\ndataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.\n  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across\nall evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86InterSyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cSEIR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u7ec7\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SynJudge\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSEIR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cInterSyn\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u5bc6\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaInterSyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1SynJudge\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SEIR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff1bInterSyn\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "InterSyn\u548cSynJudge\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that\ncombines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement\n(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network\n(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning\n(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty\nDisentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification.

For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters\nproportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters\nproportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed\nfinal adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent\nstate-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes.

Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.\nThe first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,\nand then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a\nVAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours\nof continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame\ninto a high-dimensional feature vector.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time\nrendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due\nto the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion\nrepresentations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in\nexisting methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,\nand weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively\nhinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured\nand consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It\nfirst identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses\nredundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided\nDeformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,\neliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained\ndeformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor\nresolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level\ntransformations.

The learned\nconcept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to\ngenerate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to\nviewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world\nexperiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that\nAngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial\npatches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success\nrates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative\nimprovement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research\nadvances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides\ninsights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties\nin T2I-generated contents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Angle-Robust Concept Learning\uff08AngleRoCL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86T2I\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8865\u4e01\u89d2\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAngleRoCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfcT2I\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u89d2\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAngleRoCL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u8d85\u8fc750%\u3002", "conclusion": "AngleRoCL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to\nlearn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly\nthrough the proposed voxel occupancy attention.

The\nrefined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of\nevery part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their\nkinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the\nsynthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset\nthat pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models.

Many different training approaches have been proposed to\nimprove the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In\ncomparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this\npaper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image\nand a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we\nextract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using\na VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining\nmatches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the\nindividual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder\nVLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL\ncompositionality.

Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only\nneeds to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This\narises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the\nmodel to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.\nFrom feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases\nsimultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address\nthis, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous\nmemories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old\ntasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error\nErasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in\nthe feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of\npotentially biased samples.

But is task-specific training really necessary for\naccurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we\nintroduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method\nthat achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric\nand vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves\nboth accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a\nsparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that\nimproves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final\nranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles\nof instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks\nerrors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,\nwhere it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen\nobjects.

Designing proteins that bind\nto a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and\nchemistry.

Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly\ndetection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent\nsynergistic relationship.

Their analysis has attracted considerable\ninterest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,\ncriminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME\nresearch is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional\ninformation conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME\nrecognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.\nTherefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual\nfeatures and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion\nframework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study\nintroduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables\nsynchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system\nsignals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming\nthe constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841\nmacro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,\nestablishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and\nconducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the\ndataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating\nthat integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting\nperformance.

In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,\nwhich can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of\nmulti-modal and multi-capability.

We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory\npairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and\ncapability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within\nOctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,\nwe build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce\nlow-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a\nHybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,\nAction-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains\nspecifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT\nand Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which\nshow impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to\ninvestigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation\nfield, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists.

This task remains fundamentally\nchallenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and\nambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts\nhave sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera\nposes of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and\nthe necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:\nthe performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as\ndata scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D\nknowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of\nreducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated\nby and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D\ninductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views.

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

For\nlarge-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform\nsuperpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,\nexisting GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,\nand the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of\ndifferent class semantics during information aggregation.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,\nlarge-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly\nexpands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new\nquestion-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We\ndeveloped a systematic method using large language models to generate these\nquestions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's\ninference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world\nclinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations\nthat mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two\nmain evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test\nmodel robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more\nchallenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate\nthe development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in\nclinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data\nprinciples, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.\nCode and data: https://github.com/Simula/Kvasir-VQA-x1 and\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/SimulaMet/Kvasir-VQA-x1", "AI": {"tldr": "Kvasir-VQA-x1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u539f\u59cbKvasir-VQA\uff0c\u5305\u542b159,549\u4e2a\u65b0\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MedVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e34\u5e8a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u5e38\u89c1\u6210\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u6807\u51c6VQA\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Kvasir-VQA-x1\u65e8\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5faaFAIR\u6570\u636e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards.

Then, a wavelet\ntransform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such\na method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted\nfeatures are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object\nprediction.

The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most\nstudents, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this\nimportant topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are\nrare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual\nabilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The\nproblems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining\nprinciples of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not\nonly to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,\nand have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the\nstudents. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better\nthan all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the\nbest scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985.

While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing\napproaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in\ndomains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have\nintroduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these\nprivacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated\nfine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain\nlacking. In this work, we present \\textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic\nbenchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two\nmainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning\nstrategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four\ncross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,\ncovering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive\nexperiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM\narchitectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task\nfederated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal\nconfiguration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods\nexhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in\nvision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and\nencoder-based VLM architectures.

However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution.

Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and\neasily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific\nsolutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,\nsensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a\nmagnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly\ncustomizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a\nhobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired\nshape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,\nparameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and\nits mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts\nconvex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular\ndesign framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to\nadjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization\nexperiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE\nof 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for\nshear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to\nunseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that\nimprove manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving\n91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy\nfor successful completion.
