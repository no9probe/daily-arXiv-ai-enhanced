The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely\nforgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall\nutility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often\nutilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI\nservices for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,\ndependence on these external resources is often impractical and could\npotentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct\ntoken optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs\nthat directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for\nexternal resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of\ntokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the\nremaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model\nutility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the\nlatter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\\times$ improvement in forget quality\non several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a\ncomparable level of model utility."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent\nCollaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that\nextends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\nOur method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy\nexploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state\ninformation and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to\nperform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,\nreducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation\nfidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of\nour approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to\nmulti-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on\ntrajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence regularization.

To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based\nValidated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)\nframework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and\nencourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher\ndifficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories.

However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit\nthis inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that\nDLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising\nprocess and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows\nthat if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate\nstep, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in\naligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can\nreadily bypass the safety guardrails.

However, standard supervised learning often leads to\nunintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious\ncorrelations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In\nthe literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,\nsacrificing context information for improved generalization.\n  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first\napproach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without\ncompromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of\nrecognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by\na robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised\nmodels and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even\nwithout fine-tuning.

Experimental\nevaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%\nimprovement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client\ndropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,\nprivacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These\nfindings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy\nfederated diagnosis of rare conditions."}

Most existing approaches\nrely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,\nor employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,\nwe introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication\non-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and\nassess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of\nthe responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message\ntransmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically\nupdated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.\nSince the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without\nadditional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg.

As we often only have access to the output of\nalgorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to\nexamine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as\nrace) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual\nfairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains\na challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual\nmeasure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the\ncombination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper\naddresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives\ninformative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational\ndata. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness\nmeasures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS\ndataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,\nage, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS\nscore when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative\n(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age."}

In order to\ncomplement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several\nmethods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods\nextract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using\ndifferent types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require\na clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For\nexample, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly\ninformative to understand the influence of the social context on the single\nworm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract\nbehavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not\nnecessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the\nbehavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees\nthe process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural\nanalysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are\ninterpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The\neffectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to\nwhich the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the\nmovement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal\nlocomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we\nshow that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural\nclassification process."}

This is even more crucial for\nlearning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data\nstructure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no\ninformation about past operations except what is inferred from its current\ncontents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security\nguarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data\nstructure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic\nupdates.\n  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which\nautomatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,\na simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic\nsetting.

One reason for this is the \"prior hole\" problem. A prior\nhole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low\nprobability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper\nproposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are\nknown to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the\nELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency\non MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the\nnormalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.\nThe variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show\nthat such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating\noptimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit\nvariational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We\ncompare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple\nSOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior\nholes, and better sampling efficiency."}

This challenge\nintensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history\nexists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to\nidentify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit\npreference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and\nresponses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we\nterm personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology\nthat transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using\npsychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework\ncreates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains\ndepending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual\nexpertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy.

In\nthis research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening\nthat enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To\neffectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution\ncalled Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each\ncharacter across different conditioning representation spaces.

In this work, we study why, by\nreverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via\n\\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of\nlong-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the\nmodel encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit\nmultiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using\nattention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''\npairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products\nin attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and\ndigits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and\nefficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these\ninsights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find\nthat the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range\ndependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an\nauxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,\nwhich provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn\nmulti-digit multiplication.

Methods: The authors propose a new method for\nsearching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method\nconsisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a\nuser-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose\nencoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,\nsummed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular\nregions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D\noffset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to\ncubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even\nif they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric\nwere compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor\nImage Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the\nproposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional\ncomputation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search\nmetrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were\nhigher than those of the conventional metric.

Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks.

In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent\ncommunication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible\nalternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous\nproblem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention."}

This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data.

It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I\nmodels and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical\nconstructs.

We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse\nphenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited\nproperly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust\nPolicy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights\nto suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.\nNotably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high\nstaleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance\ntokens while maintaining stable optimization.

We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference\ndatasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.\nMotivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,\ntraining-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse.
