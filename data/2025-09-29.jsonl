We attribute\nthis limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available\ninformation (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality\nassessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize\ncontext quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and\nintroduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric\nquantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when\nremoving each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware\nrelevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI\nvalue eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining\ncontexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label\ndependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate\nmodel for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a\nhierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and\nglobal inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision\nand end-to-end generator feedback.

Moreover,\ntext-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In\nresponse to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling\nAttack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic\ncomponents of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:\nfirstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe\nprompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that\ncan bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that\ntrigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into\nnatural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model\nto modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic\nconsistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,\nthe visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to\nguide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{UltraHorizon} a\nnovel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for\ncomplex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across\nthree distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are\ndesigned in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover\nhidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools\nmanagement, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale\nsetting, trajectories average \\textbf{200k+} tokens and \\textbf{400+} tool\ncalls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \\textbf{35k} tokens\nand involve more than \\textbf{60} tool calls on average.

These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset.

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an\nartifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure\nsubstantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen\nreverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this\nstructure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically\ndependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only\nsuffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further\nintroducing logical inconsistencies.

Our\nsystem employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a\nuser action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then\nsynthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.\nThis approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim\nprovides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and\nsynthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the\nway for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI\nagents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI\ngeneration baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,\nhighlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and\nenhance AI agent training."}

This design preserves recent\nfine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all\nwhile maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x\ninference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task\nsuccess. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and\nhybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training\npipelines or downstream control logic."}

This draft policy misalignment limits achievable\nspeedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training\nwith the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree\nReward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of\nthe draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;\n(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that\ncontrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming\ndebiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along\nthe longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that\nincreasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and\nspeedup.

However, these models may also be\nabused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.\nExisting jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving\npotential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,\ntext-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In\nresponse to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling\nAttack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic\ncomponents of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:\nfirstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe\nprompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that\ncan bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that\ntrigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into\nnatural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model\nto modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic\nconsistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,\nthe visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to\nguide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content."}

Previous works only consider single image as visual\nmodality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.\nIn this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal\ngaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world\napplications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze\nmodality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then\nutilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the\nGLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process\nto handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to\nincorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their\npretrained knowledge.

We propose DyME, an on-demand\nerasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and\ndynamically composes only those needed at inference.

Through a\ncarefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often\nproduce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental\nlimitation in their spatial-semantic understanding.

In\nparticular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,\nintroduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at\ndifferent positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple\nyet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image\ntokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

To address this gap, we introduce\nSceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a\nharmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach\nmanipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential\nvideo outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful\nconstraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually\ncorresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their\nsequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an\nunsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a\nharmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene\nmanipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe\nregion. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness.

Analyzing this process, we identify three design\nimplications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use\npreliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and\npolicy development as evolving together. These implications highlight\nactionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful\nfor policy."}

Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.

To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale\nAdaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive\nAttention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).\nOur PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse\nfeatures from the encoder and decoder.

By leveraging 30\\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves\nbetter performance than GRPO with full tokens.

However, these methods\ntypically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive\nmaps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For\nexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using\nmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB\ntraining data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as\na novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.\nOurs project page: https://miv-xjtu.github.io/JanusVLN.github.io/."}

However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual\nconditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by\ntext prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon\nor imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a\nspecific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.\nIn contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common\nsettings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can\nserve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models\nstruggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low\ntext fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose\nSemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned\nbut semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses\nthe influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while\nstrengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary\ndenoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition\n(e.g., \"a human playing guitar\" for a human pose condition) to extract\ninformative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising\nof the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar).

Furthermore, the\ndiversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most\napproaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for\nlegal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through\ntight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel\nTop-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM\nemploys syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We\nevaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical\nresults demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing\nbaselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability."}

Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,\nwhile the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant\nmodel and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group\naction.\n  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the\nfunction acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group\naction. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an\nangular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a\nscale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.\nThis decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs\nwhile preserving the underlying group symmetry.\n  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including\npolynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix\nprediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our\nmodel consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and\nefficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function."}

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a\nrobust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of\nteaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages."}

To measure\nthe importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information\nbased on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address\nthe computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,\nHEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the\nsecond-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert\nparameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic\nexpert outputs.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs.

Our analysis shows that\nleft-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora\ncontaining significantly more politically engaged content than post-training\ndata. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics\nthrough distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant\nstance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases\nwhen evaluated on policy issues.

To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a\npenalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes\nforgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our\nmethod enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a\nsimilarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and\nretention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.\nTo ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable\nconvergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our\napproach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model\nutility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and\nlanguage benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing\nunlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility."}

We propose treating verbal\nfeedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image\ngeneration, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the\nfeedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback\npairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum\nlikelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping\nstage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh\nfeedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as\nconditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more\nexpressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

More recently, it has also been\nadopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work\non creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not\naccount for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and\nappropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram\nnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of\ntop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,\ncautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike\nhuman-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with\nlower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source\nmodels, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative\nexpressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a\npositive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).\nOverall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave\nroom for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic\nexpressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the\nbest-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences."}

However, for\ntasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual\neffects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple\ncode execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture\nthe actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose\nWebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and\nmulti-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website\ncodebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding\nthe screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual\nlanguage model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The\nscreenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and\nselect-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the\naccurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further\nintroduce \\textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve\nthe ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using\nthe screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we\nprovide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively\nimproves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,\nWebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%\nand its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art agent system.

Recent advances in pre-trained\nvision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this\ntask. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as\n\"a photo of a [CLASS]\", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual\nconcepts. For example, recognizing \"cat\" versus \"car\" depends on coarse-grained\ncues, while distinguishing \"cat\" from \"lion\" requires fine-grained details.\nSimilarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the\nrepresentation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information\ncontained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical\nRepresentation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages\nLLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby\naugmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues.

We introduce DeeptraceReward, the\nfirst fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates\nhuman-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises\n4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each\nannotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box\nregion containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset\ntimestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of\ndeepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train\nmultimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and\nlocalizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by\n34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.\nInterestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.\nreal classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace\ndetection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language\nexplanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).\nBy foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a\nrigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video\ngeneration."}

Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable\ndata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to\nmodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality\nand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the\nlimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.\nA primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the\ninherently subjective nature of what constitutes a \"good\" caption. We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image\ncaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple\nsettings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B\nresults in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks.

SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice.
