### [1] [LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge: automating error analysis in natural language generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09147)
*Nadezhda Chirkova,Tunde Oluwaseyi Ajayi,Seth Aycock,Zain Muhammad Mujahid,Vladana Perlić,Ekaterina Borisova,Markarit Vartampetian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge的方法，通过生成结构化报告而非数值评分，帮助开发者改进自然语言生成系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法主要依赖数值评分，缺乏对具体问题的深入分析，开发者难以据此改进系统。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 对每个实例进行开放式问题分析；2) 使用累积算法聚类问题。

Result: 该方法在2/3的情况下能正确识别实例问题，并能生成类似人工标注的错误类型报告。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge为NLG系统提供了更直观的改进方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

### [2] [PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175)
*Peidong Wang,Jian Xue,Rui Zhao,Junkun Chen,Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语词典偏置的方法，显著提升了语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于短语在训练数据中罕见，语音翻译任务中短语的正确翻译具有挑战性。

Method: 利用源语言到目标语言的短语映射对，提出短语词典偏置方法，应用于流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型。

Result: 短语词典偏置方法在流式语音翻译模型中相对短语列表偏置提升了21%，并在多模态大语言模型中实现了85%的短语召回率相对提升。

Conclusion: 短语词典偏置方法有效提升了短语翻译的准确性，并支持多模态大语言模型利用外部短语信息。

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

### [3] [A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218)
*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）在语音规则泛化中的能力，提出了一种新方法，通过绕过全连接层（FC）来生成音频输出，证明了卷积层可以动态泛化语音依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度神经网络（尤其是生成式卷积神经网络）是否能够从词汇学习中泛化语音规则，并研究全连接层瓶颈缩小的影响。

Method: 训练生成式卷积神经网络（CNNs）处理原始音频波形，缩小全连接层（FC）瓶颈至8通道，并提出一种绕过FC的新技术来生成音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，绕过FC生成的音频输出与通过FC生成的输出在语音规则限制上具有相同的偏差，证明卷积层可以动态泛化语音依赖关系。

Conclusion: 卷积层能够独立于全连接层学习到的词汇约束，动态泛化语音规则，为语音处理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

### [4] [Extrapolation by Association: Length Generalization Transfer in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09251)
*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer模型可以通过任务关联实现长度泛化的转移，即通过训练相关任务提升对未见长输入的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型如何通过任务关联实现长度泛化，以理解其泛化能力的来源。

Method: 通过训练模型在相关任务（如算术、字符串变换、迷宫导航）上，观察其对目标任务的长度泛化能力。

Result: 模型可以从相关任务中继承泛化能力，预训练模型也表现出类似效果，且与注意力头的重用相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer模型泛化能力的机制，强调了任务间归纳结构的组合重用。

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [5] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（SAAM）用于检测游戏聊天中的亲社会行为，相比现有技术提升了7.9%，并在资源有限的情况下实现了自动化分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注毒性内容检测，而亲社会行为同样重要但缺乏相关数据集和模型。

Method: 结合无监督发现和游戏领域专家合作，提出SAAM模型，利用整个训练集作为“锚点”提升性能。

Result: SAAM在《使命召唤：现代战争II》中有效分类亲社会行为，性能提升7.9%。

Conclusion: 研究为在线平台提供了从惩罚毒性转向鼓励积极互动的新工具。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

### [6] [Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277)
*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，通过比较LLM生成的自我自然语言解释（self-NLE）与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量测量其忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖行为测试或计算块识别，未能深入模型推理的神经活动，导致无法准确评估self-NLE的忠实性。

Method: 引入一种灵活框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量测量忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并建立了self-NLE与模型推理的直接联系。

Conclusion: 此方法推进了对self-NLE忠实性的理解，并为生成更忠实的self-NLE奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

### [7] [$(RSA)^2$: A Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware Rational Speech Act Framework for Figurative Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09301)
*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA（(RSA)^2）框架，用于解释比喻性语言，无需建模说话者的动机，结合LLMs在讽刺解释任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比喻性语言（如讽刺、夸张、低调陈述）在人类交流中普遍存在，但现有RSA框架无法解释或需特定建模动机。

Method: 引入(RSA)^2框架，通过考虑说话者的修辞策略来建模比喻性语言。

Result: (RSA)^2无需建模动机即可实现与人类兼容的非字面解释，结合LLMs在讽刺解释任务上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: (RSA)^2为比喻性语言提供了一种更通用的解释方法，并在实际任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

### [8] [Alzheimer's Dementia Detection Using Perplexity from Paired Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09315)
*Yao Xiao,Heidi Christensen,Stefan Goetze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Mistral-7B大语言模型的配对困惑度方法，用于检测阿尔茨海默病（AD），显著提高了检测准确率，并提供了可解释的决策边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）常伴随语言能力下降，现有方法检测准确率有限且决策过程不透明。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B大语言模型改进配对困惑度方法，并通过提示微调模型分析语言模式。

Result: 检测准确率比现有最佳方法提高3.33%，比ADReSS 2020基准方法提高6.35%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能高效检测AD，还揭示了模型对AD语言模式的学习能力，为模型解释和数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [9] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一系列新方法（如Lion、WebR、LTE、BMC和FollowBench）来改进大语言模型（LLM）的对齐问题，涵盖数据收集、训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法依赖人工数据集或专有模型，效率低且多样性不足，亟需更高效、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出Lion（对抗蒸馏框架）和WebR（自动合成数据框架）改进数据收集；开发LTE（知识编辑框架）和BMC（优化偏好对齐）改进训练；设计FollowBench评估对齐效果。

Result: Lion和WebR显著提升数据多样性和可扩展性；LTE和BMC优化了知识更新和对齐效果；FollowBench揭示了模型在复杂约束下的不足。

Conclusion: 新方法在数据、训练和评估方面均取得进展，为LLM对齐提供了更高效、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备理论心智能力，通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架验证其协作推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs是否能推断他人意图，对实现人机协作至关重要。

Method: 利用LLM驱动的智能体，通过自然语言交互在多智能体强化学习环境中测试协作能力。

Result: LLMs在协作任务中展现出一定的意图推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具备初步的理论心智能力，为人机协作系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

*Siheng Li,Zhanhui Zhou,Wai Lam,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePO通过利用多样化的回放策略从回放缓冲区中检索离策略样本，显著提升了大型语言模型的优化效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO方法因使用多个同策略输出导致的高计算成本和低数据效率问题。

Method: 引入Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO)，利用回放策略从缓冲区中检索离策略样本，实现更广泛的样本优化。

Result: 在五个LLM和七个数学推理基准测试中，RePO显著提升了性能（Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B提升18.4分，Qwen3-1.7B提升4.1分），同时计算成本仅增加15%，有效优化步骤增加48%。

Conclusion: RePO是一种高效且性能优越的强化学习方法，适用于大型语言模型的优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository

*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了小型语言模型中潜在多头注意力（MLA）的效率与质量权衡，发现MLA+RoPE在降低内存的同时几乎不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小型语言模型中潜在多头注意力的性能与效率，为内存受限的应用提供优化方案。

Method: 训练30M参数的GPT模型，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA及MLA+RoPE三种架构。

Result: MLA+RoPE在减少45%内存的同时仅增加0.3%验证损失，且推理速度提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE是内存受限部署的帕累托改进方案，RoPE对小型模型中的MLA性能至关重要。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: OmniDRCA展示了并行建模的优势，并具备扩展到全双工会话场景的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

### [14] [DIVE into MoE: Diversity-Enhanced Reconstruction of Large Language Models from Dense into Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09351)
*Yuchen Feng,Bowen Shen,Naibin Gu,Jiaxuan Zhao,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DIVE的多样性增强重建方法，用于将密集LLM重构为MoE LLM，通过领域亲和性挖掘、基于剪枝的专家重建和高效重训练，显著减少训练开销并提升专家多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE LLM重建方法往往忽视专家多样性，导致冗余。本文观察到不同校准数据集剪枝后的LLM具有显著多样性，从而提出DIVE方法。

Method: DIVE方法包括领域亲和性挖掘、基于剪枝的FFN模块重建和高效重训练（路由器、专家和归一化模块）。

Result: 实验表明，DIVE在相同激活参数数量下，训练效率高且精度损失小，优于现有剪枝和MoE重建方法。

Conclusion: DIVE通过增强专家多样性，显著提升了MoE LLM的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户查询的模糊性和SQL的多解性，评估生成的SQL语义等价性具有挑战性，本文旨在利用LLMs解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析SQL等价和不等价的常见模式，研究LLM在评估中的应用及其挑战。

Result: 提出了基于LLM的语义和弱语义等价评估方法。

Conclusion: LLM在SQL语义等价评估中具有潜力，但仍需解决相关挑战。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
Text-to-SQL (NL2SQL) systems, yet evaluating the semantic equivalence of
generated SQL remains a challenge, especially given ambiguous user queries and
multiple valid SQL interpretations. This paper explores using LLMs to assess
both semantic and a more practical "weak" semantic equivalence. We analyze
common patterns of SQL equivalence and inequivalence, discuss challenges in
LLM-based evaluation.

*Zhengyuan Liu,Stella Xin Yin,Dion Hoe-Lian Goh,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COGENT是一个面向课程的框架，用于生成适合年级的教育内容，解决了生成AI在教育中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI在教育应用中常无法符合课程标准和年级阅读水平，尤其在STEM教育中难以平衡科学解释与日常语言。

Method: COGENT整合科学概念、核心思想和学习目标，控制可读性，并采用“基于好奇”的方法提升学生兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，COGENT生成的文本在年级适宜性上优于或等同于人工参考。

Conclusion: COGENT为扩展高质量自适应学习资源提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

*Yang Liu,Jiaqi Li,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RuleReasoner是一种通过动态采样和强化学习提升小型推理模型（SRMs）规则推理能力的方法，显著优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型推理模型在多样化任务和领域中规则推理的泛化能力问题。

Method: 引入动态采样方法，基于历史奖励调整不同领域的采样权重，无需人工设计训练配方。

Result: 在ID和OOD任务上显著优于前沿大型模型，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner为小型模型提供了一种高效、泛化能力强的规则推理解决方案。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLMbo是一种创新的说话人语言模型，通过结合说话人编码器和提示条件，生成详细的说话人描述，解决了传统说话人识别系统在捕捉人口统计属性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅能完成分类任务，无法生成详细的说话人特征或上下文丰富的描述，尤其是人口统计属性（如方言、性别、年龄）的结构化捕捉。

Method: CoLMbo整合了说话人编码器和基于提示的条件，通过用户定义的提示动态适应新的说话人特征，生成定制化描述。

Result: CoLMbo不仅提升了传统说话人分析能力，还在零样本场景中表现出色，适用于多样化数据集。

Conclusion: CoLMbo在说话人识别领域取得了显著进展，为生成详细说话人描述提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何自动区分低质量与高质量新闻标题/链接，测试了12种机器学习模型，发现传统集成方法和微调DistilBERT均表现良好，但后者训练时间更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻的泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，研究旨在自动区分其质量。

Method: 使用115个语言特征，评估12种机器学习模型，包括传统集成方法和微调DistilBERT。

Result: 传统集成方法（如bagging分类器）表现良好（88.1%准确率），微调DistilBERT准确率最高（90.3%）。

Conclusion: NLP特征结合传统分类器或深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，但需权衡预测性能与训练时间。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLM）在礼貌用语上的表现，发现大模型能复现人类礼貌策略，但过度依赖负面礼貌策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能在礼貌用语上像人类一样灵活应对不同社交情境。

Method: 通过约束性和开放性任务比较人类与LLM的礼貌策略使用。

Result: 大模型（≥70B参数）能复现人类礼貌偏好，但过度依赖负面策略。

Conclusion: LLM在礼貌策略上表现优异，但需进一步优化以实现更精准的语用对齐。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

TL;DR: KT$^2$是一种基于知识树的知识追踪框架，通过层次化知识概念和隐马尔可夫树模型，在低资源条件下提升学生知识状态预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实课堂中知识追踪常面临数据稀缺和需在线更新的挑战，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 提出KT$^2$框架，利用层次化知识概念构建隐马尔可夫树模型，通过EM算法估计学生掌握程度，并支持增量更新。

Result: 实验表明KT$^2$在低资源在线环境下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过层次化知识结构和增量更新机制，有效解决了低资源知识追踪问题。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出Token Constraint Decoding (TCD)方法，通过约束token级预测提升大语言模型在噪声环境中的鲁棒性，实验显示其显著恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多选题任务中表现优异，但对输入扰动高度敏感，需提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TCD算法，结合提示工程(PE)，通过token级预测对齐增强模型稳定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TCD显著恢复性能，尤其对弱模型提升达39%。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用且模型无关的方法，可提升LLM在现实应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

*Xiujun Zhou,Pingjian Zhang,Deyou Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PGDA-KGQA是一个基于提示引导的数据增强框架，用于知识图谱问答（KGQA），通过生成多样化的训练数据提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多样标注数据和多跳推理样本稀缺、语义失真以及数据多样性不足的问题。

Method: 采用提示设计范式，结合LLMs生成大规模（问题，逻辑形式）对，包括单跳伪问题生成、语义保留问题重写和答案引导的反向路径探索。

Result: 在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上显著优于现有方法，F1、Hits@1和准确率分别提升2.8%、1.2%、3.1%和1.8%、1.1%、2.4%。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过数据增强策略有效提升了KGQA任务的性能，尤其在多跳推理和语义对齐方面表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 在数字化世界中，欺骗检测是一项关键且具有挑战性的任务，研究旨在评估LLMs和LMMs在不同欺骗场景中的表现。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本方法，结合随机或基于相似性的上下文示例选择，评估LLMs和LMMs在三个数据集（RLTD、MU3D、OpSpam）上的表现。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在文本欺骗检测中达到最优性能，而LMMs在多模态线索利用上表现不佳。辅助特征（如非语言手势）和提示策略（如链式推理）的影响也被分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在多模态欺骗检测中的潜力与局限性，为实际应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的SFT方法，减少灾难性遗忘风险，同时提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT虽增强LLMs的任务适应性，但会削弱其通用能力，且第三方实施时因缺乏原始数据加剧灾难性遗忘。

Method: 重建基础模型的SFT指令分布，多模型筛选最优数据，与新数据混合进行SFT。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持通用领域能力的同时提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFT中的灾难性遗忘问题，且成本更低。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Conclusion: UniToMBench揭示了LLMs在ToM任务中的优势和局限，为未来研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现DAA中存在奖励-生成差距，即训练目标与生成性能不匹配，影响模型表现。

Method: 提出POET方法，截断响应至相同长度，优化DAA目标，使其更关注前缀标记。

Result: 实验显示POET在DPO和SimPO上表现优于标准实现，AlpacaEval 2提升15.6分。

Conclusion: 解决奖励-生成差距对DAA性能至关重要，POET方法简单有效。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

Motivation: 自杀是西方国家的主要死因之一，社交媒体的普及为研究自杀行为提供了新视角。

Method: 采用计算自下而上、混合和专家自上而下三种方法，分析181个自杀未遂者YouTube频道和134个对照频道的数据。

Result: 发现五个与自杀未遂相关的主题，其中两个随时间变化显著；专家未识别的平台特定指标（如YouTube参与度）具有价值。

Conclusion: 综合方法提供了对自杀行为的深入理解，连接了数字行为与临床认知。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

*Jiayi Yuan,Hao Li,Xinheng Ding,Wenya Xie,Yu-Jhe Li,Wentian Zhao,Kun Wan,Jing Shi,Xia Hu,Zirui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的性能可重复性受系统配置（如GPU数量、类型和评估批次大小）影响显著，尤其在推理模型中，早期令牌的微小差异会导致结果大幅波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM性能时，基准分数的准确性和可重复性是关键假设，但现有研究未充分探讨数值精度对可重复性的影响。

Method: 通过在不同硬件、软件和精度设置下的实验，量化模型输出的差异，并提出轻量级推理管道LayerCast以平衡内存效率和数值稳定性。

Result: 实验显示，推理模型在bfloat16精度下，准确率波动可达9%，响应长度差异达9,000令牌。浮点运算的非结合性是主要原因。

Conclusion: 数值精度对LLM推理的可重复性至关重要，但常被忽视。LayerCast通过混合精度计算有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at
https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

*Bingheng Wu,Jingze Shi,Yifan Wu,Nan Tang,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（RoPE），解决了Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM）在位置编码上的不一致问题，并设计了一种混合架构（model），在性能和效率上均优于传统Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在长序列建模中各有优势，但两者的位置编码机制不一致（RoPE vs. 卷积隐式编码），导致整合时性能下降。

Method: 提出统一的RoPE方法，为自注意力和状态空间组件提供一致的位置编码框架，并基于此设计混合架构model。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，model的训练和推理速度分别比标准Transformer快42.3%和29.5%，语言建模任务中准确率提升4%以上，且扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 统一的位置编码解决了混合模型中的位置不兼容问题，实现了高效且高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在知识密集型医学问答中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建ReasonMed数据集，采用多智能体验证和精炼过程，设计Error Refiner优化推理路径。

Result: ReasonMed-7B模型在医学推理任务中表现优异，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: 结合详细推理和简洁答案摘要的微调策略最有效，ReasonMed为医学推理研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-Infused RAG通过整合知识图谱（KG）和认知启发的扩散激活机制，提升了检索增强生成（RAG）的事实准确性和多源检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常依赖单一知识源且缺乏认知启发的知识激活机制，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出KG-Infused RAG框架，结合KG事实和扩散激活机制，扩展查询并增强生成。通过偏好学习优化关键步骤。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG比普通RAG性能提升3.8%至13.8%，且能作为插件提升其他RAG方法。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种有效的多源检索增强生成框架，具有可解释性和通用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

TL;DR: MEDUSA是一个多模态框架，通过四阶段训练流程解决情感识别中的类别不平衡和情感模糊问题，并在挑战赛中排名第一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类情感的主观性和自然条件下情感分布的不均衡，情感识别（SER）任务具有挑战性。

Method: 采用四阶段训练流程，包括基于DeepSER的集成分类器训练、Manifold MixUp正则化、可训练元分类器优化，并结合人类标注分数、平衡数据采样和多任务学习。

Result: MEDUSA在Interspeech 2025挑战赛的情感识别任务中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEDUSA通过多模态和分阶段训练有效解决了SER中的关键问题，表现出色。

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively
handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an
ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human
annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and
multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic
Conditions Challenge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Google Translate和DeepL在英语到希腊语翻译中的性别偏见，并测试了GPT-4o作为缓解偏见的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引起关注。

Method: 研究使用GendEL数据集（240个句子）分析了三种性别偏见，并测试了GPT-4o的缓解效果。

Result: 发现MT系统在性别明确时表现良好，但在未指定性别时仍存在偏见；GPT-4o在多数模糊情况下表现较好。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在缓解性别偏见方面有潜力，但仍需改进。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一系列资源（包括语料库、指令数据集和评估套件）以支持低资源语言马其顿语的LLM研究，并训练了一个8B参数的模型，性能优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球技术普及对工具的需求增加，但低资源语言的LLM能力有限，限制了相关国家的应用。

Method: 收集40GB马其顿语语料库和106k指令数据集，构建评估套件，并训练8B参数模型domestic-yak。

Result: 模型在8B参数范围内表现最佳，性能接近更大模型，且被母语者评价更高。

Conclusion: 公开所有资源，为类似低资源语言的LLM研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities.
This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs,
categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which
improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question
answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion,
and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and
highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to
existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational
efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions,
including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability,
and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of
managing more complex real-world knowledge tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型（LMs）的记忆行为与序列的内在维度（ID）相关，高ID序列更不易被记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在训练过程中记忆数据的机制，尤其是潜在结构如何影响记忆率。

Method: 通过分析序列的内在维度（ID）作为几何代理，研究其对记忆行为的调节作用。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更不易被记忆，尤其在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露条件下。

Conclusion: 记忆行为受模型规模、暴露频率和序列复杂度的共同影响。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）标注文本成本低但存在不一致性，可能影响下游参数估计，需要去偏方法结合专家标注以提升准确性。

Method: 比较了Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)和Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI)在不同任务和样本量下的表现。

Result: DSL在偏差减少和效率上通常优于PPI，但性能一致性较差；两种方法在大数据集下均能实现低偏差。

Conclusion: 去偏方法存在偏差-方差权衡，需进一步研究如何量化其在有限样本中的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Method: 使用Buckeye语料库比较三种模型：信息论公式NDL、传统NDL和N-gram概率预测器。

Result: N-gram模型表现最佳，但信息论公式能提升NDL性能。

Conclusion: 需结合频率、上下文预测性和平均预测性，以及信息论指标与判别学习信息，以优化声学缩减建模。

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

Result: 手语翻译模型性能提升19%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效增强数据集，提升手语翻译性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: RAPL通过结构化检索和推理策略，显著提升了知识图谱问答的检索能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

Result: 在事实问答和数学推理任务中优于基线方法，并能用于高效RAG和模型级联。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低推理成本并保持性能，适用于自适应推理场景。

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: FT-UKE方法在非结构化知识编辑任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了有效的训练方案。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

Result: Inv-Entropy在实验中优于现有语义不确定性量化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且高效，为LLM的不确定性量化提供了新的理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComfyUI-R1是一个用于自动生成AI工作流的大型推理模型，通过两阶段训练（CoT微调和强化学习）显著提升了工作流的格式有效性和结构完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的工作流定制需要高专业知识，ComfyUI-R1旨在降低用户学习门槛，实现自动化工作流生成。

Method: 使用4K工作流数据集构建长链推理数据，通过CoT微调和强化学习训练7B参数模型。

Result: 模型在格式有效性、节点和图形级别F1分数上显著优于GPT-4o和Claude系列。

Conclusion: 长链推理和代码化工作流在AI艺术创作中具有潜力，ComfyUI-R1展现了高效生成复杂工作流的能力。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

*Andreas Säuberli,Diego Frassinelli,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能模拟人类在测试中的答题行为，以加速测试开发。通过分析18个指令调优的LLMs在阅读、美国历史和经济三个学科中的表现，发现校准后的模型更接近人类行为，但整体相关性不强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试开发通常需要大量人类参与者进行试点研究，如果LLMs能模拟人类答题行为，可显著加速测试开发。

Method: 基于心理测量学的经典测试理论和项目反应理论，评估LLMs在多项选择题中的表现。

Result: 较大模型过于自信，但通过温度校准后更接近人类行为；LLMs在阅读理解题中与人类相关性较高，但整体相关性不强。

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本设置下不适合用于教育评估的试点研究。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型（LRM）在复杂数学运算中的低效和不准确问题，同时避免直接结合Code Interpreter带来的技术挑战。

Method: 通过Hint-Engineering合成代码集成推理数据，结合监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习对模型进行后训练。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集上，模型性能提升4%-8%，计算开销减少30%-50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效提升了LRM与Code Interpreter的协同效率，为复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

Motivation: 当前语音情感识别数据集存在情感粒度不足、隐私问题或依赖表演情感等问题，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 利用先进的语音生成技术合成模拟情感场景的音频片段，并通过心理学专家验证情感强度标签。

Result: Empathic Insight Voice模型在语音情感识别上表现优异，与人类专家高度一致，且高唤醒情感（如愤怒）比低唤醒情感（如专注）更容易检测。

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice为语音情感识别提供了隐私保护的合成数据集和新基准，推动了AI在情感理解领域的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注图像语义与文本叙述的匹配，忽略了图像来源的准确性，导致媒体操纵检测不足。

Method: 构建了News Media Provenance Dataset数据集，定义了来源位置相关性（LOR）和来源时间相关性（DTOR）两种任务，并测试了六种LLM的基线表现。

Result: 零样本LOR表现良好，但DTOR表现较差，表明需要进一步优化架构。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在图像来源检测中的潜力与局限，为未来工作提供了方向。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

<details>

Result: 在多种数学和常识推理基准测试中，显著提高了推理效率并减少了标记使用，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升大型语言模型的推理性能和成本效益提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现优于现有基线，即使不训练核函数也保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需外部知识的、可扩展的幻觉检测解决方案，性能达到最先进水平。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: 提出针对LLMs不同发展阶段的神经元特定训练策略，实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

Conclusion: VerIF可集成到现有强化学习流程中，提升模型整体性能，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

Conclusion: QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER为通用检索器，同时提供了长上下文能力的可解释性见解。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

Result: SAE-Tuning在低成本（约1美元）和短时间（约20分钟）内实现高性能推理，如AIME24的43.33% Pass@1和AMC23的90% Pass@1。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，可跨数据集和模型应用，验证了其高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Hillary Dawkins,Kathleen C. Fraser,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 检测社交媒体上AI生成文本的难度很大，尤其是在攻击者不公开微调模型的情况下，检测效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是网络影响力活动的重要攻击载体，AI生成的帖子可能被用于支持或反对特定政策或事件，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 研究者模拟威胁行为者，创建了一个包含505,159条AI生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，涵盖11个争议话题，并测试了不同检测算法的效果。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，检测效果大幅下降，人类研究也证实了这一点。

Conclusion: 微调LLM对检测算法构成普遍威胁，这对所有检测领域都有重要影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

TL;DR: 提出了一种逐步指令策略，结合通用词性标注和简化的输出格式，在17种语言的依存解析任务中实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准提示方法在生成结构有效且准确的输出（尤其是依存解析）时表现不佳。

Method: 采用逐步指令策略，先进行通用词性标注，再预测句法头和依存标签，并使用简化的CoNLL-U格式。

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上实现了最高准确率，且无幻觉或污染。多语言微调还提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤在基于LLM的解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在塞尔维亚语、克罗地亚语和波斯尼亚语中处理有毒评论的能力，发现添加上下文片段能显著提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线有毒语言在缺乏审核工具的地区造成实际危害，本研究旨在解决这些低资源语言的有毒内容检测问题。

Method: 构建并手动标注了4500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型（GPT-3.5 Turbo、GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro和Claude 3 Opus）在零样本和上下文增强模式下的表现。

Result: 上下文增强模式平均提升召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10；Gemini在上下文增强模式下表现最佳（F1=0.82，准确率=0.82），GPT-4.1在零样本模式下精度最高且误报最低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过改进提示设计和阈值校准，可以在低资源语言环境中有效提升有毒语言检测效果。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持部分检测的数据与模型解决方案，通过构建FineHarm数据集和流式内容监控器（SCM），显著提高了检测效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核器在部分检测中存在训练与推理的差距，导致性能下降，需要一种原生支持部分检测的解决方案。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集，提出流式内容监控器（SCM），结合响应和标记级标签进行训练。

Result: SCM仅需查看平均18%的标记即可达到与全检测相当的F1分数（0.95+），并能提升安全性对齐效果。

Conclusion: SCM是一种高效的审核工具，可显著减少延迟并提高安全性。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Jiaqi Nie,Zeyu Wang,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet提出了一种动态拼接预训练模型的方法，以适应不同设备的资源限制，实现灵活的效率-精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同设备的计算和内存资源异构，传统压缩方法（如剪枝、量化）缺乏灵活性，无法适应动态资源需求。

Method: 通过计算层间相似性（CKA）选择拼接点，拼接大模型的前层和小模型的后层，仅微调拼接层。支持同构和异构模型拼接。

Result: 实验表明，ReStNet能在运行时灵活调整效率与精度，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet为动态资源环境下的模型部署提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）的安全防御策略，旨在抵御有害查询，同时避免过度防御影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成医学报告时可能面临有害查询的安全威胁，而现有防御机制可能导致过度防御，影响正常临床查询的处理。

Method: 提出了一种基于合成临床演示的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性，并引入混合演示策略以平衡安全与性能。

Result: 实验表明，该策略能有效抵御视觉和文本攻击，且增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 混合演示策略在少样本预算下实现了安全与性能的平衡，为Med-VLMs的安全应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

Motivation: 在建筑数字化发展中，墙窗自动分割是提升建筑信息模型和计算机辅助设计效率的关键步骤。

Method: SAAF采用多模态语义协作特征提取机制，结合自然语言处理技术，开发端到端训练框架，减少人工干预。

Result: 在多个立面数据集上实验，SAAF的mIoU指标优于现有方法，保持了高精度分割能力。

Conclusion: SAAF在墙窗分割任务的精度和泛化能力上取得进展，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Method: 利用新数据集和强化学习开发VersaVid-R1模型，支持多任务处理。

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项基准测试中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 新数据集和模型为视频推理领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试存在两个主要问题：指令调优数据与测试分布不匹配，以及无法区分错误是由于单一能力缺失还是多种能力不足。AVA-Bench旨在填补这些空白。

Method: AVA-Bench明确解耦了14种原子视觉能力（如定位、深度估计等），并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，从而精确评估VFMs的表现。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，使模型选择更科学。此外，发现0.5B参数的LLM在评估效率上优于7B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs的开发和评估提供了全面且透明的基准，有望推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据标注耗时且易错，现有工具仍需人工标注每张图像，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合可调放大镜、数据增强模块、标签传播和基于改进YOLOE的自动标注模块。

Result: 显著减少标注工作量，提升视频和动态数据集的标注效率。

Conclusion: BakuFlow在目标检测和跟踪中表现优异，适用于实际计算机视觉和工业场景。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

Motivation: 生成式AI的广泛应用引发了对偏见和歧视性结果的担忧，但偏见机制尚未完全明确。

Result: 实验显示偏见变化较小，但属性分类器的决策边界对结果影响显著。

Conclusion: 需改进标签实践、评估框架，并考虑属性的社会复杂性以更准确评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在不同文化背景下的公平性能问题亟待解决，但现有方法存在性能损失、事实错误或冒犯性输出等权衡问题。

Method: CAIRe通过将图像中的实体和概念与知识库关联，利用事实信息为每个文化标签提供独立评分。

Result: CAIRe在手动构建的数据集上比基线方法提升28% F1分数，并在两个数据集上与人类评分的相关性达到0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能有效评估图像的文化相关性，并与人类判断高度一致。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CREPA的新方法，用于改进视频扩散模型的微调，通过跨帧表示对齐提升视频生成的质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户级微调视频扩散模型以生成反映训练数据特定属性的视频存在挑战，且目前研究不足。

Method: 提出Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA)，通过将帧的隐藏状态与相邻帧的外部特征对齐来优化模型。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Hunyuan Video等大规模VDM上验证，CREPA显著提升了视觉保真度和跨帧语义一致性。

Conclusion: CREPA是一种广泛适用的正则化技术，能有效改进视频扩散模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchGuard是一种基于Vision Transformer的对抗鲁棒性异常检测与定位方法，通过引入伪异常样本和定位掩码，显著提升了对抗攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据限制（仅包含正常样本）易受对抗攻击，PatchGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用前景感知伪异常样本，结合ViT架构和对抗训练，通过新型损失函数提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上，PatchGuard在对抗环境下AD性能提升53.2%，AL提升68.5%，同时在非对抗环境下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过伪异常样本和ViT架构，显著提升了异常检测与定位的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的流与匹配模型（UFM），通过统一训练在共视像素上，显著提升了密集图像对应的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在宽基线和光流估计中分别处理密集对应的问题，探索统一训练的可能性。

Method: 使用简单的通用Transformer架构直接回归(u,v)流，避免了传统粗到细成本体积的复杂性。

Result: UFM比最先进的光流方法（Unimatch）准确率高28%，比宽基线匹配器（RoMa）误差减少62%，速度快6.7倍。

Conclusion: UFM首次证明统一训练可以超越专门方法，为多模态、长距离和实时对应任务开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and
HR-Pairs dataset can be found in https://github.com/CVEO/MSSDF.

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Conclusion: AAPT方法通过对抗训练和KV缓存优化，显著提升了视频生成的效率和实时性。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

Conclusion: SAGE为扩散模型的安全生成提供了高效解决方案，代码和权重将开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding
and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images. Code and Models

Conclusion: UniForward成功统一了3D场景与语义场重建，仅需稀疏视图图像即可实时实现高质量结果。

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can
be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.
Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene
and semantic field reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法和数据集局限于有限模态，无法满足实际场景中多模态查询的需求。

Method: 构建ORBench数据集（包含5种模态），并提出ReID5o框架，支持任意模态组合的融合与对齐。

Result: ReID5o在ORBench上表现最佳，验证了其先进性和实用性。

Conclusion: ORBench和ReID5o为多模态行人重识别研究提供了理想平台和解决方案。

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet
this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called
Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整先验几何的方法，用于改进OOD检测，通过实时更新协方差矩阵来纠正不良分布样本的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子空间的方法因静态提取信息几何而无法处理不良分布样本导致的几何失真，动态调整可以解决这一问题。

Method: 动态更新先验协方差矩阵，沿实时输入特征方向减少协方差，并在残差空间中约束调整，保留关键数据特征。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet-1k数据集上显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整几何信息能有效提升OOD检测的鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）的可靠伪标签方法（SRPL-SFDA），用于无源域适应的医学图像分割，通过增强伪标签质量和可靠性训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无源域适应（SFDA）中目标域无标签数据监督不足的问题，同时应对隐私和源域数据访问限制的挑战。

Method: 1）测试时三分支强度增强（T3IE）提升伪标签质量；2）基于多SAM输出一致性的可靠伪标签选择；3）可靠性感知训练。

Result: 在两个医学图像数据集上表现优于现有SFDA方法，接近目标域有监督训练的性能。

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA通过可靠伪标签和SAM的零样本推理能力，显著提升了无源域适应的性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在人类动作视频任务中常因不自然特征影响训练效果，限制了其在手语翻译、手势识别等任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用可控3D高斯虚拟人模型进行姿态迁移，生成合成人类动作视频数据。

Result: 在Toyota Smarthome和NTU RGB+D数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了动作识别性能，并能扩展少样本数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量合成数据，弥补真实数据中的不足，并开源了相关数据集RANDOM People。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NCVSD的新方法，将预训练的扩散模型蒸馏为生成去噪器，通过揭示无条件评分函数隐含地表征去噪后验分布的评分函数，实现快速生成和迭代优化的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在生成速度和样本质量之间的权衡问题，同时提升去噪后验分布的近似能力。

Method: 将无条件评分函数的特性融入VSD框架，实现生成去噪器的可扩展学习，支持从高噪声水平到多步采样的灵活生成。

Conclusion: NCVSD通过平衡生成速度和样本质量，为生成模型和逆问题求解提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法在计算成本和小物体或平坦表面表现上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 采用双分支设计：基于查询的稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息并融合输出。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度也具竞争力。

Conclusion: ODG方法有效结合了BEV和稀疏点的优势，提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为下一代多模态模型的训练和评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 轻量级架构和细粒度特征增强策略有效提升了遥感图像描述性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to unseen domains using CLIP's zero-shot capabilities. Existing methods face sample and optimization conflicts. The proposed HAM framework harmonizes and merges source models to mitigate conflicts and enhance generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CLIP-based domain generalization suffer from sample and optimization conflicts, leading to suboptimal solutions. The goal is to improve generalization by addressing these conflicts.

Method: The HAM framework enriches source samples without conflicts, harmonizes model updates, and uses a redundancy-aware merging method to integrate knowledge across source models.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show HAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HAM effectively mitigates conflicts and enhances generalization, proving its superiority in CLIP-based domain generalization.

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在开放集域泛化任务中表现优越，解决了未知类别和域偏移的挑战。

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 多车协同框架能有效提升3D LiDAR场景下的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

TL;DR: TinySplat是一种基于前馈3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的紧凑3D场景表示方法，通过消除冗余实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法存储成本高，且传统压缩方法不适用，需解决存储与兼容性问题。

Method: 结合View-Projection Transformation（VPT）减少几何冗余，Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction（VABR）减少感知冗余，以及视频编解码器减少空间冗余。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现100倍压缩，存储大小仅为现有方法的6%，编码时间减少75%，解码时间减少99%。

Conclusion: TinySplat提供了一种高效且兼容的3DGS压缩方案，显著降低了存储和计算成本。

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

TL;DR: TransDiff结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型，显著提升图像生成性能，并引入多参考自回归（MRAR）进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型的优势，提升图像生成的质量和效率。

Method: TransDiff通过联合建模框架编码标签和图像为高级语义特征，并利用扩散模型估计图像样本分布。MRAR通过多参考自回归生成图像。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，TransDiff的FID为1.61，IS为293.4，推理速度显著快于其他方法。MRAR将FID降至1.42。

Conclusion: TransDiff为图像生成领域开辟了新方向，结合MRAR进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

TL;DR: 提出广义高斯熵模型和均值误差判别器（MED），显著提升点云属性压缩的率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯和拉普拉斯熵模型未充分利用神经网络估计的熵参数信息，且固定似然区间限制了性能。

Method: 引入广义高斯熵模型控制尾部形状，并提出MED动态调整似然区间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种VAE模型中显著提升率失真性能，并可应用于其他压缩任务。

Conclusion: 广义高斯熵模型和MED有效提升压缩性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建动态3D场景是一个基础挑战，现有方法在动态场景中难以实现结构化和时间一致的运动表示。

Method: HAIF-GS通过锚点过滤器识别运动相关区域，使用自监督的流引导变形模块和多层次锚点传播机制处理复杂变形。

Result: 实验表明，HAIF-GS在渲染质量、时间一致性和重建效率上显著优于现有动态3DGS方法。

Conclusion: HAIF-GS为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

TL;DR: ReVisiT是一种简单有效的解码方法，通过引用视觉标记来指导大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的文本生成，提升视觉信息的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解码策略未能充分利用视觉信息，导致视觉无关的响应。现有方法通常需要额外训练或多步推理，ReVisiT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，动态选择最相关的视觉标记，并通过约束差异最小化优化输出分布。

Result: 在三个LVLM幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升了视觉相关性，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: ReVisiT在减少计算成本的同时，实现了与现有最优方法竞争或更优的结果。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）压缩方法，显著减少高斯基元数量，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法基于启发式重要性评分，缺乏全局保真度保证，导致内存和渲染资源浪费。

Method: 采用最优传输视角，将3DGS压缩视为全局高斯混合减少问题，通过KD树分区最小化传输差异，并分离几何与外观属性进行微调。

Result: 实验显示，仅需10%的高斯基元即可达到与原始3DGS相当的渲染质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS），且优于现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何3DGS流程，为轻量级神经渲染提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了T2I对抗性补丁在不同视角下的攻击效果，本文旨在解决这一问题并揭示文本对补丁角度鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 提出AngleRoCL方法，通过学习通用概念（文本嵌入）来指导T2I模型生成具有角度鲁棒性的对抗性补丁。

Result: 实验表明，AngleRoCL显著提升了补丁的多角度攻击效果，平均相对改进超过50%。

Conclusion: AngleRoCL不仅提升了对抗性补丁的角度鲁棒性，还揭示了文本概念与物理属性之间的关系。

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于图像的3D物体检测中缺乏3D几何线索导致的图像与3D表示对应关系模糊的问题。

Method: 利用预测深度生成显式（体素占用）和隐式（TSDF）3D几何表示，结合体素占用注意力优化特征体积。

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有方法，如SUN RGB-D提升9.3 mAP@0.5，ScanNetV2提升3.3 mAP@0.5，KITTI提升0.19 AP3D@0.7。

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet通过几何表示显著提升3D物体检测性能，适用于多样环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19
AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset. The project page is available at:

Abstract: Road networks are crucial for mapping, autonomous driving, and disaster
response. While manual annotation is costly, deep learning offers efficient
extraction. Current methods include postprocessing (prone to errors), global
parallel (fast but misses nodes), and local iterative (accurate but slow). We
propose GLD-Road, a two-stage model combining global efficiency and local
precision. First, it detects road nodes and connects them via a Connect Module.
Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically
reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, improving APLS by 1.9% (City-Scale) and 0.67% (SpaceNet3). It also
reduces retrieval time by 40% vs. Sat2Graph (global) and 92% vs. RNGDet++

Motivation: 现有评测基准忽视了恶劣天气和复杂场景下CoT推理的严格评估需求，亟需填补这一关键空白。

Method: 构建AD^2-Bench基准，覆盖多样恶劣环境数据，提供细粒度标注支持多步推理，并设计专用评测框架。

Result: 评测显示当前MLLMs准确率低于60%，突显基准的难度和提升需求。

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench为标准化评测平台，推动自动驾驶中MLLMs推理能力的研究，成为重要资源。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat实现了几何、外观和语义的联合建模，提升了3D场景理解的全面性和实用性。

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关策略有效提升了视觉故事生成的主题一致性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Result: HopaDIFF在RHAS133数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为多人物动作分割提供了新方法，并展示了HopaDIFF的有效性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接物体在日常生活中普遍存在，但现有方法在无人工标注情况下难以构建统一的表示。

Method: DeGSS通过可变形3D高斯场建模每个交互状态，并利用变形轨迹进行渐进式部件分割，支持无监督学习。

Result: 实验表明，DeGSS在准确性和稳定性上优于现有方法，并发布了新的数据集RS-Art。

Conclusion: DeGSS提供了一种高效的铰接物体表示方法，适用于部件级重建和运动建模。

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

Motivation: 研究胎儿和新生儿大脑的快速神经发育需要高分辨率图谱，但传统方法依赖大量数据，难以应对病理情况下的数据稀缺问题。

Method: CINeMA在潜在空间中操作，避免了计算密集的图像配准，支持基于解剖特征的灵活条件设置，如孕周、出生年龄和病理特征。

Conclusion: CINeMA为大脑研究提供了强大工具，尤其在低数据环境下表现出色，代码和图谱已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Conclusion: 推理模型在信念坚持方面存在根本性局限，揭示了逐步推理与信念持久性之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step

TL;DR: 通过推理时技术改进双编码器视觉语言模型（VLM）的组合性，提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过分割图像和文本片段并匹配对齐，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双编码器VLM（如CLIP）在组合性任务上表现不佳，而推理时技术的研究较少。本文旨在通过简单结构调整提升其性能。

Method: 在推理时分割图像为小区域，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），使用VLM对齐图像区域与文本片段，并聚合相似度计算最终匹配分数。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，该方法显著提升了VLM的组合性性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理时技术具有潜力，图像区域处理是关键改进点，未来可进一步优化推理时方法。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

Motivation: 早期诊断AD（尤其是轻度认知障碍阶段）面临主观评估和多模态成像高成本的挑战，现有深度学习方法能效低且计算需求大，限制了实际应用。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FasterSNN表现出竞争力，显著提升效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: FasterSNN为AD筛查提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

Result: 基准测试显示现有方法仍有改进空间，CHIP提出了独特挑战。

Conclusion: CHIP将公开，促进工业环境中6D姿态估计的研究。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 多任务学习和多模态输入可有效提升长期非接触式生理监测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Conclusion: MPFNet通过多源先验知识融合显著提升了微表情识别性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉处理上表现不足，仅使用图像描述的纯语言模型性能甚至优于MLLMs。为此，作者提出了一种简单的视觉扰动框架，无需额外训练即可提升感知鲁棒性，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉推理中未能有效整合视觉信息，导致性能受限。通过实验发现，纯语言模型在仅使用图像描述时表现更优，这促使作者探索如何通过视觉扰动提升MLLMs的视觉推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种视觉扰动框架，包含三种扰动策略：干扰拼接、保持主导性的混合和随机旋转。这些策略可直接集成到现有训练流程中，无需额外数据或算法修改。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多数据集上显著提升了数学推理性能，效果与算法改进相当。训练后的Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型在开源7B RL调优模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: 视觉扰动对多模态数学推理至关重要，揭示了“更好的推理始于更好的视觉处理”。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Result: 实验表明，CSCF在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，有效解决了MMHCL任务。

Conclusion: CSCF通过跨模态信息融合和类别相似性优化，在多模态异构类别集学习中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Q-SAM2是一种针对SAM2模型的低比特量化方法，通过线性层校准和量化感知训练提升效率，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2模型的计算和内存消耗高，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。

Method: 提出线性层校准方法和量化感知训练流程，优化权重分布并抑制异常值。

Result: Q-SAM2在超低2比特量化下表现优异，比未校准模型提升66% mIoU精度。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2为高效量化SAM2提供了有效解决方案，适用于训练和训练后量化。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大量任务特定训练数据的问题，探索无需训练的高效6D姿态估计方法。

Method: 采用稀疏特征提取、特征感知评分机制和模块化设计，支持实例分割模型集成。

Result: 在BOP Benchmark上达到新SOTA，速度提升8倍，精度提高5%；集成分割模型后精度再提升8%，速度仍快2.5倍。

Conclusion: FreeZeV2证明了无需任务特定训练即可高效准确估计6D姿态，获BOP Challenge 2024最佳方法奖。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward
models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to
their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,
the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D
meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

Motivation: 现有微表情研究局限于单一视觉模态，忽略了其他生理模态传递的丰富情感信息，导致性能不足。因此，探索视觉特征与生理信号的跨模态关联机制至关重要。

Method: 研究开发了MMME数据集，包含634个微表情、2,841个宏表情和2,890个同步多模态生理信号试验，并进行了广泛的实验验证。

Conclusion: MMME为探索微表情的神经机制和视觉-生理协同效应提供了关键数据支持，推动了微表情研究从单模态视觉分析向多模态融合的范式转变。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset
will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

Result: 在复杂数据集上，DynaSplat在精度和真实感上超越现有方法，且更高效紧凑。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了一种直观、高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有导航研究任务分散，缺乏通用性，需统一多模态和多能力导航。

Method: 构建OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，设计OctoNav-R1模型（基于MLLMs的VLA型），采用三阶段HTP训练（Action-/TBA-SFT、Nav-GPRO、Online RL）。

Result: OctoNav-R1性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过TBA-SFT和Nav-GPRO提升推理能力，实现了通用导航代理的显著进步。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个数据集和架构上有效提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: 通过字符分布对齐，无需重新训练即可提升现有模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

Result: 当前模型在复杂场景中对直观物理的理解表现接近随机水平（50%），远低于人类近乎完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型架构和训练方法需要进一步改进，以实现更接近人类的直观物理理解能力。

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures
and training methodologies.

Conclusion: Vireo为动态多样化环境中的鲁棒视觉理解提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需改进以支持更广泛的空间多模态任务。

Method: 利用现成的3D基础模型（如MASt3R、VGGT）提取稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，通过几何蒸馏注入预训练VLMs。

Result: 在3D视觉语言推理和感知基准测试中表现优异，显著提升3D空间推理能力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Geometric Distillation为2D训练的VLMs提供了一条高效扩展3D理解的路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: 证明了减少3D知识依赖的可行性，强调了数据驱动方法在大规模数据时代的重要性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

Conclusion: 胶囊网络架构无需预测器即可实现等变性，展示了其在姿态感知任务中的潜力和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$
of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE
and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to
non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule
architectures.

*Tao Liu,Zhenchao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出E-FPN-BS架构，解决特征金字塔网络中高层特征因零正锚点导致的语义缺失问题，通过多尺度特征增强和自适应优化提升小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征金字塔网络中高层特征（P5-P6）常因零正锚点被排除在损失计算外，导致语义表示未训练，形成高层特征无梯度更新、低层特征缺乏语义上下文的问题。

Method: 提出E-FPN-BS架构，包括上下文增强模块（CEM）进行全局-局部特征融合，前景-背景分离模块（FBSM）生成动态空间门控掩码，以及动态梯度平衡损失（DCLoss）调节梯度贡献。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法具有出色的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-FPN-BS通过系统利用高层语义增强低层特征，有效解决了小目标检测中的语义缺失和梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid
networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors
under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic
representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

### [146] [Only-Style: Stylistic Consistency in Image Generation without Content Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09916)
*Tilemachos Aravanis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Petros Maragos,George Retsinas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Only-Style的方法，用于在生成图像时避免内容泄漏，同时保持风格一致性。通过自适应调整参数，该方法在局部区域消除内容泄漏，并提出了新的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成风格一致的图像时难以有效分离语义内容和风格元素，导致内容泄漏问题。

Method: Only-Style方法通过定位内容泄漏区域，自适应调整风格对齐参数，并在局部区域消除泄漏。此外，还提出了一个评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，Only-Style在多样实例中显著优于现有方法，实现了无内容泄漏的稳健风格一致性。

Conclusion: Only-Style有效解决了内容泄漏问题，同时保持了风格一致性，为风格一致的图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

*He Zhang,Chentao Song,Hongwen Zhang,Tao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetricHMR是一种从单目图像中恢复具有准确全局平移的度量人体网格的方法，解决了现有HMR方法中的尺度和深度模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法存在严重的尺度和深度模糊问题，无法生成几何合理的身体形状和全局平移。

Method: 通过系统分析现有HMR方法的相机模型，强调标准透视投影模型的关键作用，并提出一种基于标准透视投影的射线图方法，联合编码边界框信息、相机参数和几何线索。

Result: 实验表明，MetricHMR在度量姿态、形状和全局平移估计方面达到最先进性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetricHMR通过标准透视投影模型和射线图方法，实现了度量尺度的人体网格恢复，解决了尺度和深度模糊问题。

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

### [148] [Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920)
*Jianhan Qi,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对高光谱图像（HSI）聚类的改进方法，结合了结构-光谱图卷积算子（SSGCO）和证据引导的自适应边缘学习（EGAEL）模块，通过对比学习框架实现聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图神经网络（GNNs）在高光谱图像聚类中未能充分利用光谱信息以及超像素拓扑图不准确导致语义混淆的问题。

Method: 提出SSGCO提取空间和光谱特征，结合EGAEL模块自适应优化超像素拓扑图的边权重，并嵌入对比学习框架。

Result: 在四个HSI数据集上，聚类准确率分别提升了2.61%、6.06%、4.96%和3.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了HSI聚类的性能，证明了SSGCO和EGAEL的有效性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at
https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.

*Benjamin Reichman,Constantin Patsch,Jack Truxal,Atishay Jain,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视频的视觉问答任务（OK-VQA），要求模型结合外部知识回答问题，并引入了一个包含2017个视频和5986个对话的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展视觉问答任务到基于视频的对话场景，要求模型不仅识别视觉信息，还需结合外部知识和对话上下文。

Method: 构建了一个包含视频和对话的数据集，并提供了多个基线模型进行评估。

Result: 展示了任务中的挑战，并公开了数据集供进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该任务为视觉问答和对话系统的结合提供了新的研究方向，数据集和基线模型为未来工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaNorm是一种新的线性变换方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并结合Hadamard变换，有效减少量化误差，提升扩散模型在资源受限设备上的部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成领域表现优异，但其高内存和计算需求限制了在资源受限设备上的应用。现有的后训练量化方法在处理异常值和实现高压缩比时存在困难。

Method: 提出HadaNorm方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并应用Hadamard变换，减少量化误差，支持更激进的激活量化。

Result: HadaNorm在各种Transformer模块中一致减少量化误差，实现了优于现有方法的效率-性能权衡。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为扩散模型在资源受限设备上的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LEO-VL模型，基于高效场景表示CFG，解决了3D-VL通用模型的数据扩展性问题，并在多个任务上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够理解3D场景并执行自然语言指令的通用3D-VL模型是长期目标，但现有模型在能力和鲁棒性上落后于2D模型，主要障碍是数据扩展性不足。

Method: 提出LEO-VL模型，采用CFG高效场景表示，减少token开销，并收集了70万高质量3D-VL数据。

Result: LEO-VL在多个3D QA基准测试中达到最佳性能，并通过消融研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LEO-VL和SceneDPO目标为3D-VL通用模型的扩展性和鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalVQA是一个专注于因果推理的视频问答基准数据集，填补了现有VQA数据集的不足，要求模型基于深度视觉理解而非语言线索回答问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集多关注表面感知或狭窄的物理推理问题，缺乏对真实世界因果关系的深入探究。

Method: 设计了五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预期、规划和描述性），并通过质量控制机制避免模型利用简单捷径。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在CausalVQA上的表现显著低于人类，尤其是在预期和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解和预测能力上的不足，为未来研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Conclusion: UniPre3D首次实现了对任意尺度点云和架构的统一预训练，为3D视觉提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in
natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework
trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks
simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing
number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to
computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more

this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist
models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field.
First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing
research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their
performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a
brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections
and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application
scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and
offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

Conclusion: Kvasir-VQA-x1旨在加速开发更可靠的多模态AI系统，并遵循FAIR数据原则，为研究社区提供资源。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态推理中过于依赖文本，难以处理需要精确几何理解和空间跟踪的任务。

Method: 提出了一种基于视觉空间绘图操作的新范式，包括标注边界框和绘制辅助线，并通过三阶段训练框架（冷启动训练、反射拒绝采样和强化学习）培养模型能力。

Result: VILASR模型在多种空间推理任务中平均提升18.4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过视觉空间绘图操作，VILASR有效提升了多模态推理能力，尤其在空间任务中表现突出。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义引导和顺序渲染，显著提升了绘画的艺术性和质量。

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimateAnyMesh是一个基于文本驱动的高效动画生成框架，首次实现了对任意3D网格的快速动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D内容生成面临建模时空分布的复杂性和训练数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 采用DyMeshVAE架构分离时空特征，结合Rectified Flow训练策略，并贡献了DyMesh数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能快速生成语义准确且时间连贯的动画，质量和效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了4D内容生成的实用化，所有数据和模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

*Zhenzhi Wang,Jiaqi Yang,Jianwen Jiang,Chao Liang,Gaojie Lin,Zerong Zheng,Ceyuan Yang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过区域特定的条件绑定实现多概念人类动画的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只能对单一主体进行动画，且全局注入条件，无法处理多概念交互场景。

Method: 利用掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并通过迭代方式将局部音频条件注入对应区域。

Result: 实现了高质量、可控的多概念人类中心视频生成，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式布局控制对多模态条件生成更有效。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MVP基准，用于评估视频语言模型的物理理解能力，通过最小变化对避免表面视觉或文本线索的捷径解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准因依赖表面线索而容易导致评分膨胀，无法准确评估模型的时空理解能力。

Method: 引入MVP基准，包含55K高质量多选题视频QA样本，每个样本配有最小变化对，要求模型同时正确回答两个问题。

Result: 人类表现92.9%，最佳开源模型仅40.2%，随机表现25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准有效避免捷径解决方案，更准确评估模型的物理理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Method: 引入EditInspector基准，基于人工标注的编辑验证模板，评估现有模型在多个维度的表现，并提出两种新方法改进。

Result: 现有模型在全面评估编辑时表现不佳，常出现幻觉描述；提出的新方法在伪影检测和差异描述生成上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: EditInspector为文本引导图像编辑提供了有效的评估工具，新方法在关键任务上表现更优，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过声音增强3D场景的交互体验，特别是人类手部动作与物体互动时的声音预测。

Method: 记录人类手部操作物体的视频和声音，训练一个修正流模型，将3D手部轨迹映射到对应音频。测试时，用户可通过手部姿势序列查询模型生成声音。

Result: 生成的音频能准确传达材料属性和动作，人类观察者难以区分其与真实声音。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了通过手部动作预测交互声音，为3D场景的交互性提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的图像修复方法在文本区域重建时容易产生错误的文本模式（文本图像幻觉），因此需要一种能同时恢复视觉内容和文本保真度的方法。

Method: 提出了TeReDiff框架，将扩散模型的内部特征与文本检测模块结合，通过联合训练提取丰富的文本表示作为后续去噪步骤的提示。

Result: 实验表明，TeReDiff在文本识别准确率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架为解决文本图像幻觉问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Result: 实验表明，PlayerOne在精确控制多样化人类动作和一致性场景建模方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PlayerOne开创了自我中心真实世界模拟的新领域，为世界建模及其应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation
and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world
modeling and its diverse applications.

TL;DR: AIM是一种自适应干预机制，通过代理Q函数减少人类监督的认知负担，显著降低专家监控成本并提高学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法对人类监督者的认知负担较高，需要更高效的干预机制。

Method: 提出AIM算法，利用代理Q函数动态调整干预请求，评估代理与专家行为的实时对齐情况。

Result: 实验显示AIM在连续和离散控制任务中显著减少专家监控成本，比基线方法Thrifty-DAgger提升40%效率。

Conclusion: AIM能有效识别安全关键状态，收集高质量专家演示，减少整体专家数据和环境交互需求。

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired
behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high
cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention
Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive
criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function
to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on
the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when
the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent
becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the
real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our
expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert
monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to
the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%
improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert
assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and
reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo
video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Shojaee等人的研究结果主要受实验设计限制影响，而非模型推理能力的真实表现。

Method: 通过分析实验设计的三个关键问题（如输出令牌限制、评估框架缺陷、数学上不可能的问题实例），并重新设计实验（如生成函数而非详尽步骤）来验证模型能力。

Result: 初步实验表明，在控制实验设计缺陷后，模型在之前被报告为完全失败的Tower of Hanoi实例上表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 强调在评估AI推理能力时，实验设计的严谨性至关重要。

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit
"accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds.
We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design
limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals
three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed
model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly
acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated
evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and
practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3)
Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically
impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models
are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we
control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions
instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple
models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported
as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful
experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Ming-Omni是首个开源的多模态模型，匹配GPT-4o的模态支持，并公开代码和模型权重以促进研究。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

Motivation: 比较LLMs和人类在行为博弈论中的表现，验证LLMs是否具有类似人类的有限理性特征。

Method: 通过改编自行为博弈论的实验范式（如石头剪刀布和囚徒困境），在相同条件下评估LLMs和人类的行为。

Result: LLMs再现了人类启发式行为（如基于结果的策略切换和未来互动时的合作增加），但规则应用更僵化，对环境动态变化敏感性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs仅部分模拟了人类的有限理性，需改进训练方法以增强灵活对手建模和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making
settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full
rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental
paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on
two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's
Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational
play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,
we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality
characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human
heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation
when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly
and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game
environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures
in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find
effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that
current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and
highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent
modeling and stronger context awareness.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

Result: Fast-MCTD比标准MCTD快100倍，性能相当或更好，甚至在某些任务中超过Diffuser的速度。

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD是扩散模型推理时推理的实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Result: DipLLM仅需1.5%的数据即可超越Cicero模型性能。

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在复杂多人游戏策略决策中具有潜力。

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and
competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods
rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which
demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong
performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to
Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action
combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address
this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns
equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive
factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action
assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium
policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model
using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,
surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the
Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single
agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making
and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to
increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant
attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an
agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal
norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific
application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large
models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value
principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment
evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a
top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system
application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific
viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets
for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods.
Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within
agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in
this field.

*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Intent Factored Generation (IFG)的方法，通过分阶段采样提高语言模型生成样本的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在增加多样性时仅停留在词汇层面，导致推理问题探索不足和对话代理重复无趣。

Method: IFG将采样分为两阶段：首先生成语义密集的意图（如摘要或关键词），再基于原始提示和意图生成最终响应。

Result: 该方法在数学和代码任务中提升了pass@k和强化学习性能，同时在对话任务中增加了多样性而不牺牲奖励。

Conclusion: IFG是一种简单有效的方法，通过调整提示和温度参数，可广泛应用于多种任务以提高样本多样性。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

*Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou,Antonio Rago,Maria Vanina Martinez,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类倾向于基于解释的信念修订，而非经典理论中的最小修订，这对AI系统设计有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何根据新信息修订信念，以开发能更好模拟人类推理的AI系统。

Method: 通过三项用户研究，系统调查人类在解释不一致时如何修订信念。

Result: 人类偏好基于解释的修订，即使这些修订不符合经典理论的最小修订原则。

Conclusion: AI系统应纳入基于解释的信念修订机制，以更好地与人类认知过程对齐。

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合互联网规模视频数据和少量交互数据的自监督学习方法，用于开发能够理解、预测和规划物理世界的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代AI通过观察学习理解世界和行动的挑战。

Method: 预训练无动作联合嵌入预测架构V-JEPA 2，结合大语言模型，并应用于机器人规划任务。

Result: 在多项任务中实现领先性能，如运动理解、人类动作预测和视频问答，并在机器人规划中实现零样本部署。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合少量交互数据可生成适用于物理世界规划的模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

TL;DR: ThinkQE是一种基于LLM的查询扩展框架，通过深度语义探索和检索反馈迭代优化，显著提升了Web搜索的性能和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法生成的查询扩展过于狭窄，忽略了探索和多样性需求，ThinkQE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ThinkQE采用基于思考的扩展过程和语料库交互策略，通过检索反馈迭代优化扩展。

Result: 在多个Web搜索基准测试（DL19、DL20、BRIGHT）中，ThinkQE表现优于现有方法，包括密集检索器和重排器。

Conclusion: ThinkQE通过深度语义探索和反馈优化，显著提升了查询扩展的效果，适用于多样化搜索需求。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN模型复杂度增加，降低计算成本和内存开销的需求日益迫切，稀疏性成为主流方法。研究旨在验证SET-MLP通过结构优化是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 采用稀疏进化训练（SET）和基于motif的结构优化方法，应用于稀疏多层感知机（MLP）。

Result: 预计效率提升超过40%，性能下降低于4%。

Conclusion: 结构优化有望显著提升SET-MLP的性能，同时保持较高的精度。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to
Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent
this improvement can be achieved.

*Hetvi Waghela,Jaydip Sen,Sneha Rakshit,Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态上下文扰动（DCP）的新型对抗文本攻击方案，通过动态生成上下文感知的扰动，确保语义保真和流畅性，显著提升了对抗攻击的隐蔽性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法通常局限于单词或局部文本段落的修改，忽视了更广泛的上下文，导致扰动可检测或语义不一致。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡模型误导和文本自然性。

Result: 实验证明DCP在挑战最先进NLP系统的鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的关键作用，为构建更鲁棒的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

Motivation: 揭示深度学习模型在恶意软件检测中如何依赖虚假相关性，尤其是编译器留下的空白空间，以量化其对决策的影响。

Method: 通过小规模平衡数据集的分析，对两种端到端模型进行排名，评估其适用性。

Result: 研究发现模型过度依赖编译器留下的空白空间，降低了编译代码的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为选择更适合生产环境的模型提供了依据，并加深了对虚假相关性影响的理解。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting
malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations
-- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless
through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks
mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without
quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware
detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the
compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our
seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of
two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in
production.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法难以有效抵抗恶意查询且保持良性输入的实用性，DAVSP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出视觉安全提示（在输入图像周围添加可训练填充区域）和深度对齐（通过模型激活空间监督训练视觉安全提示）。

Result: 在五个基准测试和两种代表性LVLM上，DAVSP有效抵抗恶意查询且保持良性输入实用性，并展示跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAVSP通过视觉安全提示和深度对齐的联合作用，显著提升模型安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across
various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit
the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist
malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To
address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),
which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety
Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It
preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we
propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt
through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent
ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than
prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative
LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while
preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model
generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety
Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its
overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 由于LLM无法区分输入中的指令和数据，间接提示注入攻击可能引发安全和隐私问题，而现有防御措施对适应性攻击者的评估不足。

Method: 通过公开挑战LLMail-Inject，模拟真实场景，参与者尝试在电子邮件中注入恶意指令以触发未经授权的工具调用，收集了208,095次攻击数据。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发实用的结构性解决方案提供了基础，以应对提示注入攻击。

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their
inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against
adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have
wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based
applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a
public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants
adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to
trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge
spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval
configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions
from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of
submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new
insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve
as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to
prompt injection.

Conclusion: 建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑依赖全局EER进行隐私评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动评估PE疗法忠实度耗时费力，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用预训练音频-语言模型Qwen2-Audio，通过LoRA微调处理30秒音频-转录窗口，生成核心协议阶段的标签。

Result: 在313个真实PE会话数据集上，最佳配置（LoRA rank 8，30秒窗口）的平均绝对误差为5.3秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为PE疗法的忠实度跟踪提供了可扩展框架，有望支持临床培训、监督和质量保证。

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Motivation: 神经前端在语音识别中表现不如传统方法，主要原因是过拟合问题，因此需要研究正则化方法。

Method: 采用音频扰动和STFT域掩码两种正则化方法，改进可学习特征提取前端的训练。

Result: 结合两种方法后，可学习特征与传统方法的性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: 正则化方法能有效提升神经前端的性能，使其接近传统方法。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的高计算、内存和功耗需求限制了其在云环境中的应用，EdgeProfiler旨在解决这一问题，使其适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Method: 框架采用4位量化技术，对TinyLLaMA等轻量级LLMs进行分析，通过建模估计延迟、FLOPs和能耗。

Result: 4位量化减少内存使用60-70%，精度损失2-5%，推理速度提升2-3倍，能耗降低35-50%。

Conclusion: EdgeProfiler为轻量级LLMs在边缘环境中的高效部署提供了平衡精度、能效和计算可行性的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for
evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs
offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,
their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to
cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a
systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained
edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,
Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization
techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to
estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that
4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while
maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds
are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge
devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for
INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as
Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the
importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge
environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational
feasibility.

Result: 实验显示延迟显著降低，能效提升，并发推理增加，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: SLED为边缘计算中的高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing
advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to
limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as
aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for
efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces
a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily
as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as
a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating
computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows
lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using
diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches
and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach
supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by
avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments
with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate
substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy
efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without
sacrificing model accuracy.

Motivation: 当前支持证明生成的验证工具不支持基于抽象的推理，导致可扩展性与可靠性之间存在矛盾。

Method: 将验证任务模块化为两部分：证明抽象网络的正确性，以及证明抽象相对于原始DNN的可靠性。前者由现有工具处理，后者首次提出生成形式化证明的方法。

Result: 初步实现了支持常见抽象技术的可扩展且可信的验证框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证提供了可扩展性与形式化证明的结合，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely
on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof
production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of
DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not
support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and
provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for
proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly
separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the
correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the
abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by
existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for
generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable
scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction
techniques within a formal proof framework.

### [190] [Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge: A Coordination Fabric for Billions of Minds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09335)
*Moshi Wei,Sparks Li*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ISEK是一个去中心化网络，结合人类与人工智能代理作为平等伙伴，形成自组织认知生态系统，基于Web3基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在建立一个抗审查、支持AI与人类平等协作、并通过分布式共识机制实现自适应的去中心化系统。

Method: 采用六阶段工作流程（发布、发现、招募、执行、结算、反馈）进行动态任务分配，结合多维声誉系统和原生代币$ISEK。

Result: 实现了大规模去中心化认知系统的有机发展，超越集中式限制。

Conclusion: ISEK代表了从传统平台向去中心化认知系统的范式转变。

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对任务导向LLM代理的威胁模型和评估方法，通过多代理红队系统CRAFT测试代理的鲁棒性，并提出了防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严格政策领域（如退款或取消规则）中，确保LLM代理始终遵守规则并拒绝违规请求，同时保持自然交互，是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了CRAFT多代理红队系统，利用策略感知的劝说策略测试代理的鲁棒性，并引入tau-break基准评估。

Result: CRAFT在客服场景中优于传统越狱方法，但现有防御策略仍不足。

Conclusion: 需要更强研究驱动的保护措施来抵御对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体任务分配问题中，异质性团队何时优于同质性团队，并通过奖励设计和多智能体强化学习验证了理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索异质性团队在任务分配中的优势，并研究奖励设计如何促进异质性行为。

Method: 通过广义聚合算子分析奖励设计，提出Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED)算法优化多智能体强化学习环境。

Result: 理论预测与实验结果一致，HED成功找到促进异质性的奖励机制。

Conclusion: 异质性团队在特定奖励设计下表现更优，为行为多样性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

TL;DR: UAD（无监督功能蒸馏）是一种从基础模型中提取功能知识的方法，无需手动标注，通过结合视觉模型和视觉语言模型自动生成大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细粒度对象功能对机器人在非结构化环境中完成任务至关重要，但现有方法依赖手动标注或预定义任务集。

Method: UAD利用大型视觉模型和视觉语言模型自动标注数据集，训练轻量级任务条件解码器。

Result: UAD在仿真中训练后，能泛化到真实机器人场景和人类活动，模仿学习策略在少量演示后表现优异。

Conclusion: UAD为机器人功能预测提供了无监督解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance
impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

TL;DR: Adv-BMT框架通过双向运动变换器生成多样且真实的对抗交互，解决了自动驾驶测试中长尾安全关键场景稀缺的问题，无需碰撞数据预训练，实验显示其生成场景质量高，训练后碰撞率降低20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏长尾安全关键场景，限制了自动驾驶系统的测试效果。

Method: 提出Adv-BMT框架，采用双向运动变换器（BMT）逆向预测交通运动，分两阶段生成对抗交互：对抗初始化和逆向运动预测。

Result: 生成的碰撞场景质量高，实验表明训练后碰撞率比之前工作降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT框架有效解决了数据稀缺问题，提升了自动驾驶系统的测试性能。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过在线学习和联合优化，显著提升了里程计在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics
model} outperforms state-of-the-art works. Our project page is available for

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集事件表示中的噪声积累问题降低了表示质量并增加了漏检概率，需要一种有效的方法来解决。

Method: 提出WD-DETR网络，结合小波变换去噪和基于变换器的目标预测，并引入动态重组卷积块（DRCB）以减少推理时间。

Result: 在DSEC、Gen1和1Mpx数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX上实现了约35 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: WD-DETR是一种高效且适用于实时机器人感知的事件相机目标检测方法。

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标无法捕捉感知系统输出中的动态变化和不确定性，尤其是在不同距离和天气条件下。

Method: 提出Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD)指标，结合SensorRainFall数据集，通过统计分析检测置信度方差的变化点。

Result: PCD能有效捕捉不同天气条件下感知系统的可靠性差异，而传统静态指标无法做到。

Conclusion: PCD为感知性能提供了分布感知的评估方法，支持更安全的自动驾驶系统运行。

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the
evaluation code is open-sourced at

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，抓取透明和反射物体的成功率提升44%。

Conclusion: DCIRNet有效解决了透明和反射物体的深度估计问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，神经介入手术中微导管的形状和姿态估计依赖于医生的主观判断或笨重的传感设备，限制了手术的精确性和安全性。

Method: 在导管上布置定制的不透射线标记物，并通过设计优化标记物的排列以减少跟踪误差。

Result: 在直径小于2mm的微导管上实现了形状跟踪误差小于1mm，导管滚动误差低于40度的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为微导管在双平面成像下的自主导航提供了可能。

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，实现全局到局部的动作约束，并在多个任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅正向预测下一步动作，缺乏全局目标约束。CoA 通过反向推理和任务目标驱动的动作链思考，提升动作生成的全局一致性。

Method: CoA 采用自回归结构，首先生成关键帧动作编码任务目标，随后自回归生成后续动作。结合连续动作表示、动态停止、反向时间集成和多令牌预测等设计。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中达到最优性能，表现出强大的空间泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoA 通过反向推理和全局约束，实现了灵活且高效的视觉运动策略，为复杂任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SAFE是一种高效的故障检测器，适用于通用机器人策略，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative

TL;DR: eFlesh是一种低成本、易制造且高度可定制的磁性触觉传感器，填补了机器人操作中触觉传感器的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化环境中，机器人需要感知物理交互中的力，但缺乏通用、易获取且可定制的触觉传感器导致解决方案分散。

Method: eFlesh传感器由3D打印的微结构、现成磁铁和磁力计电路板组成，提供开源设计工具以生成可3D打印的STL文件。

Result: 实验显示，eFlesh在接触定位和力预测方面表现优异，并支持高精度的滑移检测和视觉触觉控制策略。

Conclusion: eFlesh为机器人操作提供了低成本、高灵活性的触觉解决方案，其开源设计工具进一步推动了广泛应用。

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜图像中的非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化是当前研究的难点，需要新的计算方法来准确建模。

Method: 采用分层高斯混合模型，结合部分分割技术，处理构象和组成变化。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据中揭示了有生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench上表现优异。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新的高效方法，能够应对复杂的变化问题。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

Motivation: Devanagari等区域脚本的手写数字识别对多语言文档数字化、教育工具和文化遗产保护至关重要，但其复杂结构和有限标注数据对传统模型构成挑战。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行空间特征提取，结合10-qubit变分量子电路（VQC）进行量子增强分类。

Result: 模型在DHCD数据集上实现了99.80%的测试准确率和0.2893的测试损失，平均每类F1分数为0.9980，优于经典CNN。

Conclusion: 该工作通过量子叠加和纠缠等原理，为区域脚本识别设立了新基准，展示了量子机器学习在低资源语言场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种校准过程奖励模型（PRM）的方法，通过分位数回归调整PRM输出以更准确预测成功概率，并基于此提出动态调整推理预算的自适应框架（IAS），在数学推理任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM模型在预测成功概率时存在校准不足和过度估计的问题，影响了推理算法的效率。

Method: 采用分位数回归校准PRM输出，并设计实例自适应缩放（IAS）框架，动态调整推理预算。

Result: 校准后的PRM显著降低了校准误差，IAS框架在保持准确性的同时减少了推理成本。

Conclusion: 校准PRM和IAS框架的结合显著提升了推理效率，为LLM的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time
scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that
even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate
success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach,
performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align
with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates
and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive
scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on
the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a
correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number
of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each
instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method
successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline
methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling,
and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining
final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as
desired.

manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

TL;DR: LoREIN是一种新型无监督双先验集成框架，用于加速3D多参数定量MRI重建，结合低秩先验和连续性先验以提高重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前重建方法仅依赖单一先验或物理模型，导致高度不适定逆问题的重建结果不理想。

Method: LoREIN结合低秩表示（LRR）和隐式神经表示（INR），利用低秩先验和连续性先验提升重建质量。

Result: 通过INR的连续表示优化低秩子空间的空间基，实现加权图像的高保真重建，并提升定量参数图的准确性。

Conclusion: LoREIN为零样本学习范式提供了广泛潜力，推动了医学影像领域的进步。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural
networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to
classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and
augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to
ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and
prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation.
The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\%

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden,
particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where
it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection
dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent
survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited
accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive,
resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral
cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost
alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability
and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial
intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access
to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that
generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter
oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with
Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten
tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by
expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is
designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in
publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance
automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis
in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality
and better patient outcomes worldwide.

Result: 确定了INR图像从低通傅里叶样本中精确恢复的充分采样条件，并通过实验验证了理论。

Conclusion: INRs在连续域图像恢复中具有潜力，理论结果为其在逆问题中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs
represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network
taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel
representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating
images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,
we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image
from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with
ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight
decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this
non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex
penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a
sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is
exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our
theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of
images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the
performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom
images.

Conclusion: 需标准化且心理学的培训，AI系统需谨慎设计并由专家监督，以负责任地整合AI于心理健康领域。

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by
providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems.
As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact
of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts.
This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in
Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments.
Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing
design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.

Conclusion: 深度学习在外汇预测中潜力巨大，未来可结合情感分析和实时经济指标提升模型适应性。

Abstract: The prediction of foreign exchange rates, such as the US Dollar (USD) to
Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), plays a pivotal role in global financial markets,
influencing trade, investments, and economic stability. This study leverages
historical USD/BDT exchange rate data from 2018 to 2023, sourced from Yahoo
Finance, to develop advanced machine learning models for accurate forecasting.
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like
ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is
applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial
capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net
loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates
normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and
policymakers robust tools to mitigate risks. Future work could integrate
sentiment analysis and real-time economic indicators to further enhance model
adaptability in volatile markets.

### [220] [Large Language Models for Design Structure Matrix Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749)
*Shuo Jiang,Min Xie,Jianxi Luo*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）解决设计结构矩阵（DSM）中的组合优化问题，提出了一种结合网络拓扑和领域知识的新框架，实验表明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法在处理复杂依赖网络时难以捕捉上下文细节，LLM因其高级推理和上下文理解能力有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的框架，整合网络拓扑和领域知识，迭代优化DSM元素排序。

Result: 实验表明，该方法收敛更快且解质量优于随机和确定性基线，领域知识的引入显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLM通过结合语义和数学推理，为解决复杂工程优化问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or
development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure
Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and
enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging
combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations.
As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate,
traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often
fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective
solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for
advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based
framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for
iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem.
Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves
faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic
and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual
domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of
the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical
reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based
engineering design optimization.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用基础模型（如LLMs）和多智能体协作，推动智能设计向更高适应性、自主性和效率发展。

Method: 回顾智能设计的历史演变，提出ID 4.0的概念框架，并讨论其通过多智能体系统实现自动化设计的能力。

Result: ID 4.0有望支持复杂设计场景的自动化，提升设计效率和创新性。

Conclusion: ID 4.0为智能设计提供了新方向，未来需进一步探索复杂场景、协调机制和人机价值对齐。

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced
engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent
decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and
interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models
(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general
knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for
further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper
introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by
agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four
distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning
models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of
multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and
discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design
processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems.
Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID
4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design
implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design
goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a
foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity,
autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design
challenges.

Motivation: 探讨AI在传统认为需要人类智力的任务中的表现，及其对工程教育和实践的影响。

Method: 将热力学考试同时提供给学生和o3模型，以相同标准评估答案。

Result: o3在零样本模式下正确解答所有问题，成绩优于所有学生，达到历史最佳水平。

Conclusion: AI在复杂任务中的卓越表现标志着技术转折点，需重新思考工程教育和职业需求。

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large
language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most
students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this
important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are
rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual
abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The
problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining
principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not
only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,
and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the
students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better
than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the
best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is
a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of
human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the
work of engineers and the education of future engineers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地面网络部署密度的增加，探索非地面网络（NTN）在减轻地面网络负载和实现可持续网络方面的潜力。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机（MAB）和BCOMD算法，实时优化带宽分配、用户设备关联和宏基站关闭等关键参数。

Result: 系统级模拟显示，该框架在高峰时段显著减少不满足需求的用户设备比例，并在低流量时段实现19%的吞吐量增益和5%的能源节省。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在集成TN-NTN架构中表现出色，优于标准的3GPP推荐设置，为可持续网络提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures
offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for
the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for
these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load
and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less
attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of
terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in
supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online
optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback
Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively
optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment
(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network
capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations
over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the
proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%
throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming
standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

TL;DR: UTGenerator和UTBoost是LLM驱动的测试用例生成与增强框架，解决了SWE-Bench中测试用例不足的问题，显著提升了代码生成评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE-Bench中手动编写的测试用例不足以检测生成的补丁是否真正解决问题，导致评估结果不准确。

Method: 提出UTGenerator自动生成测试用例，并基于此构建UTBoost框架进行测试用例增强。

Result: 在评估中，发现了345个错误补丁，影响了SWE-Bench的排行榜排名。

Conclusion: UTGenerator和UTBoost有效提升了代码生成评估的可靠性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard
entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.

<details>

Motivation: 现有代码生成模型未明确管理推理深度，导致资源分配不高效。通过控制推理深度，可以优化模型全生命周期的性能。

Method: 提出自适应控制推理的方法，包括监督信号增强、多维基准测试和成本感知部署策略。

Result: 通过调度快速和慢速推理模式，实现更优的准确性、延迟和成本平衡。

Conclusion: 将推理深度作为可控资源，可提升代码生成模型的效率和适应性。

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation
models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being
an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between
rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought
deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that
optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic
data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior
trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive
control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new
multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious
deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes
to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and
act fast when possible.

Motivation: 明确商业SHI实践对rAI的贡献及潜在脱节，为未来干预提供依据。

Method: 分析56份rAI指南，进行在线调查（n=130）和半结构化访谈（n=10）。

Result: 商业SHI主要受商业目标驱动，与rAI目标不一致。

Conclusion: 需针对性干预和研究以推动rAI实践。

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement
(SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in
commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This
study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to
contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential
insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry
practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to
identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and
uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical
understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To
understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we
then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)
with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily
driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several
factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that
established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To
address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to
advance rAI development in practice.

Motivation: 3DGS在资源受限的移动设备上无法满足90 FPS的实时需求，现有加速器忽视了内存效率问题。

Method: 采用完全流式设计，从基于瓦片的渲染转变为内存中心渲染，实现细粒度流水线并减少DRAM流量。

Result: 设计在移动Ampere GPU上实现了45.7倍加速和62.9倍能耗节省。

Conclusion: STREAMINGGS通过优化内存效率显著提升了3DGS在移动设备上的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on
compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM
traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS
algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and
reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a
memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7

Motivation: 现有运动插值方法依赖复杂模型，而本文旨在探索简单模型结合数据优化是否能取得更好效果。

Method: 使用单一Transformer编码器，重点优化数据建模（如数据量、姿态表示和速度特征）。

Result: 实验表明，数据优化能显著提升运动插值质量，甚至优于复杂模型。

Conclusion: 模型复杂度并非动画质量的决定因素，数据优化是关键。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Abstract: We leverage finetuned video diffusion models, intrinsic decomposition of
videos, and physically-based differentiable rendering to generate high quality
materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a
video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,
roughness, metallic) from the generated video. Finally, we use the intrinsics
alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly
extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.

Conclusion: DGS-LRM为动态场景重建提供了高效、高质量的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

Motivation: 理解人类如何通过简化的心理表征高效灵活地规划任务，以及空间注意力如何影响任务表征和规划。

Result: 空间接近性和自然注意力轮廓显著影响任务表征的简化与规划效率，个体差异明显。

Conclusion: 将视觉空间注意力纳入计算模型，有助于更全面地理解人类如何通过简化表征辅助规划。

Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive
resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel
problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people
construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the
complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a
nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes
planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this
interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to
characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task
representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We
find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for
planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)
contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful
maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across
individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and
behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the
effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of
value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives
on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals
represent their environments in aid of planning.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets
remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the
use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this
methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube
lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

TL;DR: BemaGANv2是一种基于GAN的高保真音频生成模型，通过引入AMP模块和MED架构改进生成器和判别器，提升了长期音频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进原始BemaGAN架构，以更好地建模音频中的周期性结构，并提升长期依赖关系的捕捉能力。

Method: 生成器采用AMP模块替代传统ResBlocks，判别器结合MED和MRD架构，通过多种配置和指标进行系统评估。

Result: 实验表明，BemaGANv2在客观指标（FAD、SSIM等）和主观评价（MOS、SMOS）上表现优异。

Conclusion: BemaGANv2为高保真音频生成提供了有效的解决方案，并通过开源代码促进可复现性。

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a
comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and
implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are

Motivation: AI技术的快速发展导致了许多有害事件，尤其是AI不公平问题，亟需在数据、模型和部署阶段引入公平性监控。

Result: 提出了一个可定制的通用算法，能够在不同AI决策场景中实现适应性公平性框架。

Conclusion: FAIRTOPIA框架为AI公平性研究提供了新的假设、启发和方法，基于人本、系统性和跨学科原则。

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human
supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful
incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily
criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human
principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre),
model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting
the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and
ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric
fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents
learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex
problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the
proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a
fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end
(human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive
and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm
which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision
making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured
over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an
agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on
our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages,
under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research
hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic,
interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

Motivation: AI聊天机器人在教育中的应用日益广泛，但其拟人化特性导致学生对它们的信任类型模糊，现有理论模型无法完全解释。

Method: 采用偏最小二乘结构方程模型，分析拟人化信任与技术信任对学生感知的影响。

Result: 拟人化信任更影响信任意图，技术信任更影响使用意图和感知有用性，两者共同形成独特的“人-AI信任”。

Conclusion: 需建立专门的人-AI信任理论框架，以优化AI在教育中的应用效果。

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are
turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the
anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding
whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or
instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of
technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical
challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human
intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed
for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic
systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and
system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived
enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived
usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and
learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,
we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student
perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted
trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral
intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived
enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we
propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots
(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of
trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific
to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately
calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical
impact of AI in education.

TL;DR: 论文通过两种方法（特征工程和深度学习）从加速度数据估计内脏脂肪组织（VAT），发现其与代谢健康风险密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内脏脂肪组织（VAT）是代谢健康和日常身体活动（PA）的关键指标，与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗高度相关。研究旨在探索PA与VAT的关系。

Method: 使用NHANES数据，采用两种方法估计VAT：1）基于步态和睡眠运动的特征工程和岭回归；2）基于24小时连续加速度数据的深度神经网络。

Result: 两种方法结合后，VAT估计的相关系数达到r=0.86，表明PA与VAT及代谢健康风险密切相关。

Conclusion: 研究证实PA与VAT存在强关联，进一步支持PA对代谢健康的积极影响。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Result: 模型在MNIST数据集上实现了高分类率，证明了CPC与SNN结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明CPC可与SNN有效结合，SNN不仅能用于分类任务，还能作为编码机制。

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

Conclusion: GADC在多无人机系统的双重目标优化中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的威胁模型，用于比较不同越狱攻击方法的有效性，发现离散优化攻击优于基于LLM的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异大，缺乏统一评估标准。

Method: 构建N-gram语言模型，评估攻击文本的分布可能性，适配流行攻击方法进行基准测试。

Result: 攻击成功率低于先前报告，离散优化攻击表现更优，有效攻击利用罕见bigrams。

Conclusion: 威胁模型提供可解释性分析，揭示攻击利用罕见文本特征的现象。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity模型在抗体-抗原亲和力预测中表现出高效性和优越性，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

TL;DR: FinHEAR是一个多代理框架，结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知推理，提升语言模型在金融决策中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在金融决策中缺乏对人类行为模式（如信息不对称下的专家依赖、损失厌恶和反馈驱动调整）的捕捉能力。

Method: FinHEAR通过多代理框架，结合历史趋势分析、事件解读和专家知识检索，融入行为经济学原理。

Result: 在金融数据集上，FinHEAR在趋势预测和交易任务中表现优于基线模型，准确率和风险调整收益更高。

Conclusion: FinHEAR通过结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知，显著提升了语言模型在金融决策中的表现。

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于用户反馈的奖励微调方法PageLLM，用于优化搜索和推荐结果的展示，通过结合页面级和项目级奖励机制，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务（如全页优化WPO）中的微调需要大量人工标注数据，成本高昂。用户反馈虽噪声多但可替代人工标注，因此需要一种有效利用用户反馈的方法。

Method: 提出PageLLM方法，采用混合粒度的奖励机制，结合页面级（整体质量）和项目级（关键推荐准确性）奖励，优化LLMs的微调。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上验证，PageLLM优于基线模型，并在在线A/B测试中实现0.44%的GMV增长。

Conclusion: PageLLM通过用户反馈驱动的奖励机制，有效解决了LLMs在WPO任务中的微调挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在特征转换中存在稳定性和有效性挑战，现有方法无法同时解决。

Method: 结合LLMs的符号生成与ML的梯度优化，分为四个步骤：高质量样本生成、特征转换序列嵌入与搜索、学生LLM知识蒸馏、LLM-ML解码器协作。

Result: 实验表明团队策略提升下游性能5%，减少近半错误，且高效稳健。

Conclusion: 团队框架有效解决了生成式AI在特征转换中的挑战，并揭示了LLMs对原始数据的理解能力。

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

Conclusion: LLMs结合性能强化，有望实现硬件特定和高性能GPU编程的自动化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了域外任务性能，同时保持了域内任务能力。

Conclusion: LwPTV方法灵活且高效，可与其他模型合并方法结合，提升多任务学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用生成概率增强奖励模型的方法，通过响应轨迹中的过程一致性改进奖励学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型依赖粗粒度的响应级分数，难以识别与分数相关的具体组件，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 利用生成概率建立响应轨迹中的奖励一致性，提出内部轨迹一致性正则化方法。

Result: 改进的奖励模型在RewardBench上表现更好，且能诱导更好的DPO对齐策略和BON推理结果。

Conclusion: 通过过程一致性正则化，奖励模型的性能和泛化能力显著提升。

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型中记忆与泛化的关系，发现模型容量与学习模式之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索记忆与泛化在语言模型中的关系，以理解模型容量如何影响学习行为。

Method: 通过预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，在合成字符级任务中分别测试泛化（算术外推）和记忆（事实回忆）。

Result: 小模型能泛化但无法记忆，大模型能记忆但无法泛化；中间容量模型偏向记忆。联合训练时，所有模型均无法泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练可能固有地偏向一种学习模式，研究为小语言模型的设计提供了启示。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Motivation: 解决异构数据源中特征偏移的定位问题，避免下游分析性能下降。

Method: 提出FSL-Net，通过训练学习数据集的统计特性，无需重新训练即可定位新数据集中的特征偏移。

Result: FSL-Net能够高效且准确地定位高维数据集中的特征偏移。

Conclusion: FSL-Net为大规模高维数据集中的特征偏移定位提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The
code and ready-to-use trained model are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UPQ的渐进量化框架，用于将指令调优的LLM从FP16量化到INT2，结合了块级后训练量化和蒸馏量化感知训练，实现了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限设备上部署大型语言模型的挑战，尤其是针对指令调优模型的2位量化问题。

Method: UPQ框架分两步：先用块级PTQ将FP16模型量化到INT4，再用Distill-QAT进一步量化到INT2，最小化JSD散度。

Result: UPQ首次实现了开源指令调优LLM的INT2量化，无需专有数据，在MMLU和IFEval基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: UPQ为指令调优LLM的极低位量化提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaTT是一个统一的Tensor Train适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调。相比LoRA，MetaTT通过共享TT分解所有子模块，显著减少参数，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有微调方法（如LoRA）参数过多的问题，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Method: 使用Tensor Train（TT）分解所有Transformer子模块，通过索引结构轴（如层和矩阵类型）共享参数。

Result: MetaTT在标准语言建模基准测试中，显著减少参数，同时保持与LoRA相似的准确性，甚至优于其他基于张量的方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT提供了一种高效、灵活的微调方法，适用于多任务共享适配器，且优化过程简化。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: 代理在TextFrozenLake和ALFWorld等任务中表现出更高的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过事实抽象和LLM模拟提升在线学习能力，适用于复杂交互任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法在通信效率、模型精度和计算成本之间存在显著挑战，FLoRIST旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，FLoRIST在通信效率和性能上均表现优异，适用于同质和异构环境。

Conclusion: FLoRIST为联邦学习中的高效微调提供了一种数学上准确且计算高效的方法。

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

Result: 在D4RL数据集和自定义GridWorld环境中验证了PG-Kmeans和CAAE的有效性，能够将轨迹划分为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans和CAAE为基于策略的轨迹聚类提供了有前景的框架，适用于离线RL及其他领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

Conclusion: 自适应池化方法能够有效解决信号噪声比波动带来的性能问题，并在多任务中表现优越。

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

Result: 在多种环境中高效学习准确的MAD表示，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAD框架为强化学习任务提供了通用且高效的状态表示方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法对不同程度的采样频率变化具有鲁棒性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

Motivation: 传统持续学习方法忽略了真实数据中的偏差，导致模型学习到虚假相关性，影响知识保留和迁移。

Method: ErrorEraser包含两个模块：错误识别（通过概率密度分布识别偏差样本）和错误擦除（通过调整决策空间消除错误知识）。

Result: 实验表明，ErrorEraser显著减少了数据偏差的负面影响，提高了准确率并降低了遗忘率。

Conclusion: ErrorEraser为持续学习中的偏差问题提供了一种有效解决方案，适用于多种CL方法。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Result: 实验表明LPO在离线和在线评估中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LPO通过优化位置偏好，显著提升了GUI交互的精确性和实用性。

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI计算基础设施的高成本和LLM服务的挑战，企业常采用共享或多租户部署，但数据以明文形式存在导致隐私问题。

Method: 引入Stained Glass Transform，一种随机且序列相关的词嵌入变换方法，基于高斯混合模型的互信息理论。

Result: 通过互信息计算后验隐私估计，验证了变换后嵌入的隐私性和模型性能。

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform在保护数据隐私的同时，有效维持了LLM的实用性。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

TL;DR: Athena-PRM是一种多模态过程奖励模型，用于评估复杂推理问题中每一步的奖励分数，通过弱与强完成者预测一致性生成高质量标签，仅需5000样本即可高效运行，并在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能过程奖励模型（PRM）通常需要大量时间和资金投入，传统自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）产生噪声标签且计算成本高。

Method: 利用弱与强完成者预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的生成标准，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略提升PRM性能。

Result: Athena-PRM在多个场景（如测试时间扩展、推理步骤正确性评估和奖励排序微调）中表现优异，显著提升基准测试分数，并在VisualProcessBench中创下新记录。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM通过高效生成高质量标签和优化策略，显著提升了复杂推理问题的评估能力，为多模态推理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)的方法，通过自然语言提示改进大语言模型(LLMs)从伯努利分布中生成样本的准确性，减少采样偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能准确描述概率分布但生成样本时存在偏差，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 引入VRS，一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过提示LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝决策。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其优于直接采样。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过将经典概率工具嵌入LLM工作流程，可以提高可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法主要关注序列恢复率，忽略了生成序列的能量稳定性，EnerBridge-DPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 整合Markov Bridges与DPO，引入能量约束损失，从信息丰富的先验序列出发优化生成低能量序列。

Result: EnerBridge-DPO能设计出能量更低且序列恢复率与现有模型相当的蛋白质序列，并能准确预测ΔΔG值。

Conclusion: EnerBridge-DPO在蛋白质逆向折叠中实现了能量稳定性的显著提升，同时保持了序列恢复性能。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein
sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused
on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

Motivation: 解决传统强化学习中奖励最大化与组合性、模块化和可解释性之间的冲突，支持高维动态世界模型中的可验证长时规划。

Result: 实现了灵活、可重用和可验证的规划表示，支持快速合成元策略和跨任务规划重用。

Conclusion: OKBEs通过STOK支持组合性、模块化和可解释性，为高维动态世界模型中的长时规划和内在动机提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

Result: 算法在温和的强化学习假设下具有遗憾和最终迭代保证，且实验表明其与基于奖励的强化学习竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量偏好查询下表现优异，且支持并行化反馈收集。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov
decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference
comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了周期性信号学习的泛化能力和外推性能。

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

Motivation: LLMs在生成和分类任务中表现优异，但无法保证输出满足时序约束。

Result: TRIDENT保证约束满足，并提升输出质量，实验验证其在图像流分类和文本生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TRIDENT高效且高质量地满足时序约束，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

Method: 引入AtmosMJ，一种直接在ERA5数据上操作的深度卷积网络，采用新型Gated Residual Fusion机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ能稳定预测约500天，10天预报精度与Pangu-Weather和GraphCast相当，且训练成本低。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计是长期稳定天气预报的关键，而非非标准数据表示。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Motivation: 条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中表现优异，但其建模能力导致类别特征与无关背景信号纠缠，难以提取鲁棒且可解释的表示。

Result: 学生模型在训练后表现出强大的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，更专注于类别信号而非虚假背景线索。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CDMs不仅可以作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑、可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.
