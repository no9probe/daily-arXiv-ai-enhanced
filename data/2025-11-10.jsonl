We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for\nidentifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography\ndatasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets\nrespectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully\nconcentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with\nAUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn).

Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as\nSecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario,\nusing DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves\nthe strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and\nDeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies\nindependently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware\nevaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a\ntransparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in\nLLM-based phishing detection."}

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large\nlanguage models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating\nthe tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring\npreservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the\nperformance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their\nlinguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a\nhuman benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a\ntempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a\nsuite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),\nwhile preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also\nattains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a\ndisconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a\nstatistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a\ncomprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,\ndiscourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for\nmechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five\nreadability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the\nevolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the\ninstruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics\nfor metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary\ndomain-adaptation issue for simplification."}

To address this challenge, prior works have\nexplored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from\nperformance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce\nPuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high\naccuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE\nperforms sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy\nand specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and\nexpert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary\nmasks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses\nunderutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up\nto 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context\ninjection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the\ngeneration process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on\nthe model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with\nuser-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output\nquality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a\nhigh-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly\nrewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection\nmodule is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning\nis employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core\npersonalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to\nuser-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to\nfurther refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.\nComprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by\ndecoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of\nexplicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO\nintroduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be\nseamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new\nand effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}

Automated segmentation could enhance precision\nand efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.\n  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used\nto train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two\nvariants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped\nregions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference\n(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated\ninto 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.\n  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume\nmodel across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =\n0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic\nsegmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective\nintraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with\nclinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.\n  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net\nprovides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The\nmethod enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for\nhepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing\nmanual workload and procedure time."}

PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300\nrealistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic\nevaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral\nspecifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that\nleading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral\npolicies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their\ncompliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to\n84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and\nsafety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic\nbehavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both\nthe dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust\nand context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques."}

The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues\nand acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other\nhand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)\nmodels are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This\nwork proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised\npipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.\nThere are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to\ngenerate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction\nmodel and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of\nNuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually\nannotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good\ngeneralization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly\navailable datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and\nweakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully\nsupervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent\nand explainable to physicians."}

To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations\ninto a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task\ntypes, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000\nhigh-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined\nthrough systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art\nLLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear\nhierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover,\nby aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass\nprovides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing\nagentic coding capabilities in large language models."}

However, prevailing definitions and\ntherefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical\nknowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical\nknowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying\nethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI\nliteracy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment\nmodel for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for\neffective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development\nof a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative\nassessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program\nincluded training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with\npractical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI\nin a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the\ncompetition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past\nresearch or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for\nAI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments\nthat emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract\ntechnical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical\nbackgrounds for AI-integrated roles."}

We\npresent DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that\nco-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and\ntransformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a\nbidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings\nguide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)\ntransformer representations refine GNN message passing through\nattention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis\nshowing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds\nthan independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with\n6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion\nmechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation.

Official code:\n  https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R", "summary": "Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens\nof thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate\nlong-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow\nthe search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted\nsearch process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal\nsearch benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as\nlong-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,\nTimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%\nimprovement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video\nreasoning model Video-R1.
