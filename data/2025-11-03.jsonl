Model outputs\nare mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert\nguidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings\nhighlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including\nstructural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final\nscores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate\nrepresentations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the\nlimitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level\ngrading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational\nBanff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant\npathology."}

Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises\nfurther acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple\nmodels has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs\nspeculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference\nacceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation\nquantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade\nalgorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.\nWe introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the\nmulti-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics\nof acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves\nstate-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative\ndecoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\\times$ to $2.3\\times$ over\nautoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets.

First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative.

Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment."}

As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate\nhow frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national\ndata protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites\nand identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the\nrelevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation\non 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic\nmanipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to\nmeasure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This\nenables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button\nplacement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common\nthan previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user\nand/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the\nEuropean Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,\nand websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU\nand from IP addresses in the United States (US).

Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and\ncomputed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,\nsmall and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired\nwith 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid\nrule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,\nwe propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,\nCT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges\nglobal contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing\nclinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human\nevaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report\ngeneration quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding."}

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.
