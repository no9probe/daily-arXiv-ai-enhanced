### [1] [How Significant Are the Real Performance Gains? An Unbiased Evaluation Framework for GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06331)
*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无偏见的评估框架，用于解决GraphRAG方法中现有评估框架的两个关键缺陷，即无关问题和评估偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法的评估框架存在无关问题和评估偏见，可能导致性能结论的偏差或错误。

Method: 提出基于图-文本-问题生成的无偏见评估框架，并采用无偏见的评估程序消除LLM答案评估中的偏见。

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升较之前报道更为温和。

Conclusion: 尽管评估框架可能仍有缺陷，但强调了科学评估对GraphRAG研究的重要性。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

### [2] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TESU-LLM框架通过统一编码器将文本和语音映射到共享潜在空间，仅用文本数据训练语音语言模型，性能媲美多模态数据训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖大规模配对语音-文本数据和计算资源，难以扩展和普及。

Method: 使用统一编码器对齐文本和语音的潜在空间，通过轻量级投影网络将编码器输出与LLM嵌入空间对齐，实现仅用文本监督训练。

Result: TESU-LLM在多个语音相关任务中表现优异，性能接近多模态数据训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TESU-LLM提供了一种无需语音数据的高效、可扩展的语音LLM构建方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

### [3] [Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347)
*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种软提示方法和LLM辅助标签转移框架，以解决多游戏和多语言环境中的毒性检测扩展问题，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏社区中的毒性检测在多游戏和多语言环境下扩展时面临效率和性能挑战，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 1. 引入软提示方法，使单一模型能处理多游戏；2. 开发LLM辅助标签转移框架，扩展多语言支持。

Result: 在多种语言中实现了32.96%至58.88%的宏F1分数，德语表现优异，生产环境中显著减少资源消耗。

Conclusion: 该方法在多游戏和多语言环境下高效且可扩展，成功应用于实际生产环境。

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

*Panagiotis Koletsis,Christos Panagiotopoulos,Georgios Th. Papadopoulos,Vasilis Efthymiou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合方法，结合知识图谱和统计分析，用于检测未标记表格数据中列间关系（CPA任务），并通过实验验证了其竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格解释任务的重要性日益凸显，但现有技术在处理未标记数据时仍有挑战，因此需要结合知识图谱和统计分析的混合方法。

Method: 使用知识图谱作为参考点，结合大语言模型（LLMs）和统计分析方法（如域和范围约束检测、关系共现分析）来减少潜在关系的搜索空间。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在减少搜索空间和提升性能方面有效，且与现有先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在CPA任务中表现优异，且开源实现可供进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06376)
*Heng Dong,Kefei Duan,Chongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的Actor-Critic框架LAC，通过长期动作评估改进LLM策略，解决了复杂决策场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在需要长期推理和高级目标对齐的复杂决策场景中仍存在不足。现有方法在模拟和评估结果方面受限，导致决策不理想。

Method: LAC框架通过计算与正负结果相关的Q值来提取稳健的动作评估，并结合未来轨迹推演和推理，同时采用无梯度机制实现高效策略改进。

Result: 实验表明，LAC在多种环境中（如ALFWorld、BabyAI-Text和WebShop）表现优于现有方法，甚至在使用较小参数LLM时超越基于GPT-4的基线方法。

Conclusion: LAC展示了将结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识结合的潜力，可提升多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

### [6] [Detection Method for Prompt Injection by Integrating Pre-trained Model and Heuristic Feature Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06384)
*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双通道特征融合检测框架DMPI-PMHFE，用于检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的提示注入攻击，结合预训练语言模型和启发式特征工程，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁，现有防御机制在效果和泛化性之间存在权衡，亟需高效且通用的检测方法。

Method: 提出DMPI-PMHFE框架，结合DeBERTa-v3-base提取语义向量和启发式规则提取结构特征，通过全连接神经网络融合特征进行预测。

Result: 实验表明，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，并能显著降低主流LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了单一特征提取的局限性，为提示注入攻击检测提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

*Pengyi Li,Matvey Skripkin,Alexander Zubrey,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSC是一种利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号的无监督强化学习方法，显著提升了推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在减少这种依赖性。

Method: RLSC通过模型自身置信度生成奖励信号，无需人工标注或外部奖励模型。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B上，RLSC仅用8个样本和4个训练周期，显著提升了多个数学数据集的准确率。

Conclusion: RLSC为推理模型提供了一种简单、可扩展且几乎无需监督的后训练方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

### [8] [Natural Language Interaction with Databases on Edge Devices in the Internet of Battlefield Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06396)
*Christopher D. Molek,Roberto Fronteddu,K. Brent Venable,Niranjan Suri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）在战场物联网（IoBT）中实现自然语言查询数据库的解决方案，显著提高了查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升战场物联网（IoBT）在关键决策中的情境感知能力，通过自然语言处理技术简化数据查询和交互。

Method: 采用LLMs将自然语言问题映射为Cypher数据库查询，并将数据库输出总结为自然语言，评估了多种中等规模LLMs的性能。

Result: Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标中表现最佳，两步法使查询准确性提高了19.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作为在边缘设备上部署LLMs以实现自然语言与数据库交互奠定了基础，适用于关键决策场景。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

*Hongming Yang,Shi Lin,Jun Shao,Changting Lin,Donghai Zhu,Meng Han,Qinglei Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP是一种针对轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）的直接行为优化范式，通过梯度自由的蒙特卡洛树搜索优化执行序列，显著提升了LwLLMs在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LwLLMs在资源效率和隐私方面有优势，但其推理能力有限，且现有提示优化方法依赖人工或高性能LLMs，不适用于LwLLMs。

Method: DeBoP将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索实现自动优化。

Result: DeBoP在七项复杂任务中显著优于其他方法，优化后的LwLLMs性能超越GPT-3.5，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，提升了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

*Sooyung Choi,Jaehyeok Lee,Xiaoyuan Yi,Jing Yao,Xing Xie,JinYeong Bak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，与人类价值观对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）可能带来更高的安全风险，尤其是在生成有害信息方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化LLMs的普及，如何确保其与人类价值观对齐的同时避免安全风险成为重要问题。

Method: 通过数据集分析和心理学假设，研究价值对齐LLMs的安全风险及其成因。

Result: 价值对齐LLMs比未微调模型更容易产生有害行为，且风险略高于其他微调模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值对齐LLMs的安全隐患，并提出上下文对齐方法以提升安全性。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SMAR的新正则化技术，通过KL散度控制多模态路由概率分布，平衡模态差异与语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态MoE模型训练成本高或语言能力下降的问题。

Method: 使用KL散度正则化技术（SMAR）控制路由概率分布，鼓励专家专业化。

Result: 在视觉指令调优实验中，SMAR保持86.6%的语言能力，仅需2.5%纯文本数据，优于基线。

Conclusion: SMAR为多模态MoE模型提供了一种高效平衡模态差异与语言能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“规范采样”的方法，旨在解决大型语言模型生成非规范标记序列的问题，并证明其生成的序列更接近训练数据的真实分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时可能生成非规范的标记序列，导致负面影响。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出“规范采样”方法，确保模型在自回归生成过程中每一步都生成部分规范标记序列。

Result: 规范采样能有效避免非规范标记序列的生成，且其生成的序列分布更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样是一种简单高效的方法，可提升语言模型生成标记序列的规范性和准确性。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种诊断框架，用于评估大语言模型在上下文与参数知识冲突时的表现，发现知识冲突对无需知识的任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，且无法完全抑制内部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文与参数知识冲突时的行为，以评估其可靠性和部署风险。

Method: 构建诊断数据，分析模型在不同任务类型中的表现，包括知识冲突和一致的情况。

Result: 发现知识冲突对非知识任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，无法完全抑制内部知识，提供冲突解释会增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 知识冲突影响模型评估的有效性，需在部署中考虑。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用合成Q/A数据集结合RAFT方法提升LLM在EDA领域的性能，并探讨了RAFTS和访问控制的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EDA领域预训练开源LLM缺乏领域知识的问题，以及获取真实Q/A数据的困难。

Method: 采用合成Q/A数据集结合RAFT方法，并研究RAFTS和访问控制的影响。

Result: RAFT结合合成数据显著提升了LLM在EDA任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据与RAFT结合是提升LLM在EDA领域性能的有效方法，同时需注意数据安全和隐私问题。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [17] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了意图幻觉概念，指大型语言模型（LLM）在处理复杂查询时部分忽略或误解条件，并引入FAITHQA基准和CONSTRAINT SCORE指标进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM在复杂查询中常忽略或误解部分条件，导致意图幻觉，需系统性评估。

Method: 提出FAITHQA基准（20,068个问题），涵盖查询和检索增强生成（RAG）场景，并开发CONSTRAINT SCORE自动评估指标。

Result: 发现意图幻觉普遍存在于先进LLM中，主要源于忽略或误解；CONSTRAINT SCORE接近人类评估表现。

Conclusion: 意图幻觉是LLM的常见问题，FAITHQA和CONSTRAINT SCORE为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

Motivation: 现有AI生成的图表标题缺乏个性化，且多模态场景研究不足，需改进。

Result: 实验表明多模态信息（如图像）比纯文本更能生成接近作者风格的标题。

Conclusion: 多模态个性化方法在图表标题生成中更有效，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Conclusion: PIC框架有效减少幻觉，提升生成内容的精确性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过正交匹配追踪（OMP）重建未见过的词嵌入，实现预训练大语言模型（LLM）中分词器的移植。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同分词器之间的差异问题，避免梯度更新，直接复用预训练模型权重。

Method: 使用OMP将新分词器的词汇表示为共享锚点词汇的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段实现嵌入空间的转换。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，OMP表现最佳，显著优于其他零样本方法，成功解决大分词器差异问题。

Conclusion: OMP方法有效支持跨分词器的知识蒸馏、解码、合并等任务，并集成到开源工具中。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

Motivation: 探索如何高效地在不同大小的语言模型间传递特征表示，以减少训练昂贵组件（如SAE）的计算成本。

Method: 使用仿射映射技术将SAE权重从小模型迁移到大模型，并比较其表示空间。

Result: 小模型和大模型的表示空间高度相似，SAE迁移可节省50%训练成本；特征级迁移显示语义和结构特征传递效果不同。

Conclusion: 仿射映射是一种高效的方法，可提升SAE训练效率，同时揭示了不同大小模型表示空间的异同。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Motivation: 探索法律简报写作这一未被充分研究的领域，评估语言模型在法律工作中的实际应用能力。

Method: 创建BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论点摘要、论点补全和案例检索，并分析当前语言模型的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在摘要和引导补全任务上表现优异，但在实际论点补全和案例检索任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，以更好地辅助法律工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Conclusion: 多会话数据集和模型为LLM在心理咨询中的应用提供了更现实的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

Motivation: 由于现有LLM安全性评估标准主观性强且缺乏明确性，作者希望通过法律视角提供更系统、全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出SafeLawBench基准，包含24,860道选择题和1,106道开放域问答任务，评估了2个闭源和18个开源LLM，并测试了其安全推理稳定性和拒绝行为。

Result: 评估显示，即使是领先模型如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o在多选择题任务中准确率未超过80.5%，20个LLM的平均准确率为68.8%。多数投票机制可提升性能。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁社区重视LLM安全性研究，并展示了SafeLawBench在系统性评估中的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

Motivation: 现有方法（如表示微调）仅能实现点对点控制，限制了语言模型行为的调控范围和效果。

Method: 通过分布级别的干预，模型不仅能学习点对点变换，还能学习概念子空间的周围区域。

Result: 在八个常识推理和七个算术推理基准测试中，分布级别干预在可控性和鲁棒性上均优于点对点干预。

Conclusion: 分布级别干预为语言模型提供了更全面的行为调控方法，实现了更精细的控制。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

Result: 动态RAG和参数化RAG在效率和效果上均有提升。

Conclusion: 论文为RAG的未来研究提供了理论基础和实践启示。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

Motivation: 在专业和高风险领域中检测LLM生成的文本对打击错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器在专业内容上表现不佳。

Method: 通过理论分析KL散度问题，提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明DivScore在AUROC和召回率上显著优于现有方法，且在对抗性设置中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: DivScore为专业领域中的LLM生成文本检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

TL;DR: RetNet是一种高效的神经网络架构，通过引入保留机制解决了Transformer的高内存和长序列处理问题，实现了线性时间推理和并行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长序列处理中的高内存成本和可扩展性问题。

Method: 引入保留机制，结合循环的归纳偏置和注意力的全局依赖建模。

Result: 在自然语言处理、语音识别和时间序列分析等领域表现优异。

Conclusion: RetNet是一种有潜力的架构，但仍需进一步研究以解决挑战并推动实际应用。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Motivation: 医疗系统复杂且难以导航，导致患者难以及时获得适当的医疗服务。

Method: C-PATH基于LLaMA3架构，通过多阶段管道微调医学知识、对话数据和临床摘要，并采用GPT数据增强框架和可扩展的对话历史管理策略。

Result: 评估显示C-PATH在清晰度、信息量和推荐准确性方面表现优异，显著优于特定领域基线。

Conclusion: C-PATH是数字健康辅助和分诊领域用户友好、准确且易用的AI工具的重要进展。

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在处理具有冲突国家视角的历史事件时是否存在地缘政治偏见。

Method: 引入新数据集，包含中性事件描述和不同国家的对立观点，测试模型反应及去偏见提示的效果。

Result: 发现模型存在显著偏见，简单去偏见方法效果有限，且模型对标签操纵敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的国家叙事偏见，挑战了简单去偏见方法的有效性，并为未来研究提供了框架和数据集。

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治话语中隐含内容的重要性及其对受众的影响，以及LLMs在语义和语用理解上的潜力，但该领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用IMPAQTS语料库，通过选择题和开放式生成任务测试LLMs对预设和隐含意义的理解能力。

Result: 所有测试模型在解释预设和隐含意义时表现不佳，表明当前LLMs缺乏必要的语用能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在政治话语中处理高度隐含语言的能力有限，但研究为未来模型改进提供了方向和资源。

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了taggedPBC数据集的CoNLLU格式版本，新增了依赖关系标注，并验证了其与专家标注的语序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: taggedPBC数据集虽大但缺乏依赖关系标注，限制了其跨语言研究的潜力。

Method: 将依赖关系信息与POS标签一起转移到所有语言中，生成CoNLLU格式数据集。

Result: 数据集中的语序信息与专家标注的语序相关性高，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 即使数据噪声较大，充分标注仍能提供重要语言学见解，依赖标注数据集已开源。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Method: 评估四种LLMs在对抗性对话中的表现，引入11种心理说服策略，提出基于直接偏好优化的自适应框架。

Result: 实验表明，特定策略（如流畅效应和重复效应）显著提高说服成功率，自适应框架进一步优化了策略选择。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法有效提升了LLMs的说服能力，同时保持了通用性能。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决文本数据爆炸导致的手动分类困难问题，提出一种更高效、通用的分类方法。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，结合双目标损失函数（交叉熵损失和余弦相似度）进行训练，推理时通过句子匹配实现分类。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得新的最优性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型在参数效率和通用性上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能可靠地区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其表现。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在某些条件下表现低于随机水平，甚至为不可能事件分配更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在区分可能事件与不可能事件的能力上不够稳健。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QG研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的能力，这对教育目的很重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略。

Result: 初步证明方法可行，但并非在所有情况下都有效。

Conclusion: 研究明确了策略的适用条件和应用中的权衡。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse

Conclusion: 结论强调了身份偏见问题的复杂性，并呼吁在算法审计中考虑更广泛的社会和技术因素，如认知不公和AI对齐。

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Conclusion: 该框架为AudioLLMs在情感推理任务中的应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: 在五个语言模型和五个数据集上的实验表明，PCoT平均性能优于竞争方法15%。

Conclusion: 说服知识对增强零样本虚假信息检测具有显著价值，同时发布了两个新数据集EUDisinfo和MultiDis。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

Result: Trans-PEFT在7个基础模型和12个数据集上验证，无需重新调优即可保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著减少实际应用中的维护开销。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

### [47] [Mixture of Small and Large Models for Chinese Spelling Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06887)
*Ziheng Qiao,Houquan Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态混合方法，结合小模型和大型语言模型的概率分布，提升中文拼写检查任务的性能，无需微调LLM即可实现领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在中文拼写检查任务中表现不佳，而微调BERT模型虽表现优秀但存在编辑模式过拟合问题。

Method: 提出动态混合方法，在束搜索解码阶段结合小模型和LLM的概率分布，平衡精确性和流畅性。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升纠错能力，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 动态混合方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，同时节省了时间和资源。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zhqiao-nlp/MSLLM.

### [48] [Automatic Speech Recognition of African American English: Lexical and Contextual Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06888)
*Hamid Mojarad,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非洲裔美国英语（AAE）中的辅音簇缩减（CCR）和ING缩减对自动语音识别（ASR）错误率的影响，并比较了有无语言模型（LM）的ASR系统在词汇邻域效应和上下文预测上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AAE的语音、音系和形态句法特征常导致ASR模型识别困难，研究旨在量化CCR和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并分析LM的作用。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（有/无LM）转录，利用Montreal Forced Aligner检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对词错误率（WER）有显著但较小的影响；无LM的ASR系统更受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: AAE的特定语音特征会影响ASR性能，无LM的系统对词汇邻域更敏感，需进一步优化以提高识别准确性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一方法在多语言情感分析中的局限性。

Method: 结合TF-IDF提取和微调XLM-R生成模块，采用动态阈值和文化适应。

Result: 在10种语言中表现优于基线，英语准确率0.90，低资源语言0.84，计算效率提升22%。

Conclusion: 适用于实时品牌监控和跨文化分析，未来将优化低资源语言处理。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for multilingual sentiment analysis that
combines extractive and abstractive summarization to address the limitations of
standalone methods. The model integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with a
fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, enhanced by dynamic thresholding and
cultural adaptation. Experiments across 10 languages show significant
improvements over baselines, achieving 0.90 accuracy for English and 0.84 for
low-resource languages. The approach also demonstrates 22% greater
computational efficiency than traditional methods. Practical applications
include real-time brand monitoring and cross-cultural discourse analysis.
Future work will focus on optimization for low-resource languages via 8-bit
quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在新闻摘要中难以保持长期语篇结构，影响读者参与度。

Method: 提出新闻语篇模式，开发DiscoSum算法，利用束搜索技术实现结构感知摘要。

Result: 人工和自动评估表明，该方法能有效保持叙事忠实度并满足结构需求。

Conclusion: 结合语篇结构的摘要方法在新闻领域具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过元分析150多篇关于提示的文献，提出了一个以属性和人为中心的框架来评估提示质量，并探讨了属性间的相关性及其对LLMs的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，提示在人类-AI交流中的重要性日益凸显，但目前缺乏对自然语言提示的量化共识。

Method: 通过元分析文献，提出包含21个属性的六维框架，并实证研究多属性提示增强在推理任务中的效果。

Result: 发现单属性增强通常效果最佳，且基于属性增强提示的指令调优可提升推理模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为属性中心的提示评估与优化奠定了基础，并推动了人类-AI交流的新研究方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0是首个针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在信念不一致推理中的表现进行评估的大规模日语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如NeuBAROCO和JFLD主要关注通用或信念一致的推理，而BIS Reasoning 1.0旨在揭示LLMs在信念不一致但逻辑有效的推理中的偏差。

Method: 通过设计逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，对包括GPT、Claude和领先的日语LLMs在内的模型进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，准确率为79.54%，但LLMs在处理信念冲突输入时存在显著弱点。

Conclusion: 研究结果对在法律、医疗和科学文献等高风险领域部署LLMs具有重要意义，强调逻辑正确性需优先于直觉信念。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）让问答（QA）代理学会提出澄清问题的方法，并通过离线RL目标优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA代理在回答自然语言问题时缺乏主动澄清问题的能力，限制了其交互效果。

Method: 通过模拟包含澄清问题的对话，利用强化学习（RL）进行训练，并提出离线RL目标（类似于奖励加权的监督微调）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化奖励和语言质量上优于基于监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化的方法。

Conclusion: 通过离线RL目标优化QA代理的澄清问题能力，显著提升了交互效果和语言质量。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种依赖类型的跨语言框架，用于分析事件的终结性和完成性，并通过英语句子建模示例展示其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于建立一个统一的框架，以形式化方式分析名词短语的有界性及其与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系，以及动词域中事件的终结性和完成性。

Method: 方法包括在名词域中建模名词短语的有界性，在动词域中定义依赖事件演算，将终结性事件建模为受限于有界经历者的事件，完成性事件则进一步达到其内在终点。框架基于Martin-Löf依赖类型理论的扩展，并在Agda证明助手中形式化。

Result: 结果表明，该框架能够有效建模名词和动词域中的相关现象，并通过形式化规则和示例验证其可行性。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为跨语言事件分析提供了形式化工具，并在理论和实践上具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖浅层统计模式。

Method: 通过语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动（如故事重构、无关约束注入等），评估700个扰动后的代码生成任务。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降达42.1%），而其他扰动则意外提升性能（准确率提升达35.3%）。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统存在脆弱性和不可预测性，需更原则性的方法提升推理对齐和提示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度容易导致非专家误解，现有模型在细粒度推理上表现不足。

Method: 提出技能链模式，动态组合模块化推理组件（原子技能），并创建SciAtomicBench基准进行评估。

Result: 仅用350个微调样本，模型表现优于GPT-4o的链式思维方法，达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 模块化技能链能有效降低认知负载，提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Motivation: LLMs在处理复杂推理任务时因训练数据缺乏深度洞察而表现不佳，需一种无需微调的方法提升其推理能力。

Method: CoM框架通过用户定义的方法论激活LLMs的系统性推理，整合人类方法论以增强结构化思维。

Result: 实验表明CoM超越基线方法，证明无训练提示方法在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: CoM通过人类方法论洞察，为LLMs实现接近人类水平的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like
methodological insights.

Motivation: 现有隐喻处理研究多基于英语数据，存在西方文化偏见，影响模型性能评估。跨文化多模态隐喻研究尚不充分。

Method: 引入MultiMM数据集（8,461个中英文广告文本-图像对），并提出SEMD模型，结合情感嵌入提升跨文化隐喻理解。

Result: 实验验证SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提高了对NLP文化偏见的认识，有助于开发更公平、包容的语言模型。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中产生的冗长思维链问题，发现其存在全局和局部对齐偏差现象，尤其是局部对齐偏差集中在句子开头的'思考线索'。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，结合主导模型和草稿模型协作解码，通过随机门平滑切换模型，减少计算开销。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FoReaL-Decoding减少30-50%的计算开销，缩短思维链长度达40%，同时保持86-100%的性能。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding是一种简单、即插即用的方法，适用于推理任务中的成本与性能平衡优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adversarial Paraphrasing的训练免费攻击框架，通过使用现成的指令遵循LLM来优化AI生成文本，以更有效地逃避检测。实验表明该方法在多种检测系统中具有广泛有效性和高迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）能力的提升引发了对其在AI生成剽窃和社会工程中滥用的担忧。现有的AI生成文本检测器虽然有所改进，但仍易受简单规避技术（如改写）的影响。

Method: 利用现成的指令遵循LLM，在AI文本检测器的指导下对AI生成内容进行改写，生成专门优化以绕过检测的对抗性示例。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多种检测系统中显著降低了检测率（如RADAR和Fast-DetectGPT的T@1%F分别减少64.49%和98.96%），且文本质量仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 该对抗性方法突显了在面对日益复杂的规避技术时，需要更强大和灵活的检测策略。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型（LMMs）主要集中在英语，缺乏对多语言和文化包容性的探索，尤其是在视频领域。

Method: 开发了ViMUL-Bench基准测试，包含8k手动验证样本，涵盖15个类别和14种语言；同时提出了ViMUL模型，并提供了120万样本的多语言视频训练集。

Result: ViMUL模型在高低资源语言之间取得了更好的平衡，ViMUL-Bench为未来研究提供了工具。

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench和ViMUL模型为开发更具包容性的多语言视频LMMs提供了基础，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统咨询模式周期长且依赖专家经验，难以满足快速发展的技术需求。

Method: 采用LoRA微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，并构建包含13,906实体和13,524关系的知识图谱，结合RAG框架优化问答。

Result: BLEU-4从18.8564提升至66.8993，ROUGE等指标显著提高，问答准确率提升2.26%。

Conclusion: 系统在交互体验和后端接入方面表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理器仅支持一阶逻辑片段，限制了更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 使用多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）结合三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG）自动提取历史事件，并将结果转换为Coq规范。

Result: 增强策略在不同性能维度上表现各异：基础生成在覆盖范围上最优，RAG在精度上更优。模型架构影响增强效果，大模型表现稳健，而Llama 3.2波动较大。Coq验证了RAG提取的事件类型的语义合法性。

Conclusion: 通过LLM和增强策略实现了高效的历史事件提取，并通过Coq规范扩展了推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Motivation: 现有医学多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在医学应用中效果有限，主要由于数据与任务的不匹配、幻觉问题及缺乏医学场景的推理能力。

Method: 提出综合数据收集方法，构建多模态医学数据集，并开发医学专用MLLM Lingshu，采用多阶段训练和强化学习增强推理能力。

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据与训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLM的性能，为医学AI应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

Motivation: LLMs在简单常识推理中表现优异，但在复杂和隐性的常识推理中存在困难，而人类更关注后者。现有研究多集中于数学和代码等复杂任务，复杂常识推理因不确定性和缺乏结构而未被充分探索。

Method: 结合因果事件图构建结构化复杂常识，采用因果理论（如干预）修改因果图以生成符合人类关注的不同场景，并利用LLM通过慢思考合成示例。此外，还通过侦探故事构建更具挑战性的子集。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在推理深度和广度上表现不佳，但后训练和慢思考可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: Com$^2$基准测试为评估LLMs在复杂常识推理中的能力提供了新工具，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

Result: 在三个情感计算任务中表现优于基线模型和现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效分解和整合多模态信息，显著提升了情感计算的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量大型推理模型（LRMs）推理效率的新指标REG，并通过REO-RL算法显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRMs的推理过程冗长且冗余，导致高推理成本，而现有评估方法不一致，无法有效衡量效率提升。

Method: 引入推理效率前沿（efficiency frontiers）和REG指标，提出REO-RL算法，通过强化学习优化推理效率。

Result: REO-RL在16K token预算下显著减少REG（≥50%），同时保持准确性，接近Qwen3-4B/8B的效率前沿。

Conclusion: 优化LRMs的推理效率仍具挑战性，REO-RL为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程脆弱且难以解释。现有方法（如Chain-of-Thought）缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性评估机制。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个并行代理（分别模拟溯因、演绎和归纳推理）生成推理轨迹，并将其结构化。利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理（NLI）评估一致性，选择最连贯的推理图生成最终答案。

Result: 在符号推理（WebOfLies）和数值推理（MultiArith）基准测试中，ToTh的表现优于Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding，同时生成可解释且逻辑严密的推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更鲁棒且受认知启发的LLM推理提供了一条有前景的路径。代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Result: CoT对非推理模型可能小幅提升性能，但增加答案变异性；对推理模型效果有限且增加成本和时间。

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，该方法均优于现有基线模型，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强和微调策略，显著提升了模型在低资源场景下的性能，尤其在语义覆盖和情感极性预测方面表现突出。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Conclusion: 后验采样算法为需要精确句法控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Result: GeometryZero在多个基准测试中平均提升4.29%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCPO框架有效结合辅助构造与几何推理，为小型模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x

Method: RULE将遗忘任务建模为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘数据和合成边界查询，通过可验证的奖励函数实现安全拒绝。

Conclusion: RULE不仅实现了目标遗忘，还提升了模型输出的自然性和训练效率，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

*Wenrui Zhou,Shu Yang,Qingsong Yang,Zikun Guo,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VISE基准，用于评估视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）在误导性用户输入下的迎合行为，填补了该领域系统性评测的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在现实应用中的普及，其事实一致性和可靠性至关重要。然而，模型倾向于迎合用户输入（即使与视觉证据矛盾）的行为降低了其可信度。目前研究缺乏针对视频语言领域的系统性评测。

Method: 提出VISE基准，结合多种问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务，评估Video-LLMs的迎合行为。同时探索关键帧选择作为一种无需训练的缓解策略。

Result: VISE首次将语言领域的迎合行为研究引入视觉领域，支持多类型迎合行为的细粒度分析。关键帧选择显示出通过增强视觉基础减少迎合偏见的潜力。

Conclusion: VISE为理解Video-LLMs的迎合行为提供了系统性评测工具，关键帧选择为未来缓解策略提供了方向。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

*Wenxuan Xie,Yaxun Dai,Wenhao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL框架通过动态生成和执行SQL探针，使LLM能够在推理时自主探索数据库，显著提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的理解能力，SDE-SQL旨在通过动态交互解决这一问题。

Method: SDE-SQL在零样本设置下生成并执行SQL探针，主动检索数据库信息并迭代更新模型对数据的理解。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升了8.02%的执行准确率，且通过SFT可进一步提升0.52%。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL通过动态探索数据库，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，为开源模型提供了新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

### [77] [Improving the Efficiency of Long Document Classification using Sentence Ranking Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07248)
*Prathamesh Kokate,Mitali Sarnaik,Manavi Khopade,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类中，BERT等模型因固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度受限，且仅部分句子包含关键信息，因此需要高效的内容选择方法。

Method: 采用TF-IDF句子排序，结合固定数量或百分比选择策略，以及归一化TF-IDF分数和句子长度的评分方法。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上，方法优于基线（如首尾句或随机选择），输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明在不牺牲性能的情况下，可实现显著上下文缩减，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究将信息论偏置归因评分方法应用于菲律宾语等粘着语，发现菲律宾语模型的偏置主题与英语模型不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索粘着语（如菲律宾语）中语言模型的偏置归因，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 调整信息论偏置归因评分方法，应用于菲律宾语模型及多语言模型。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏置主题集中于人物、物体和关系，与英语模型的行为主题不同。

Conclusion: 英语与非英语模型在处理社会人口群体和偏置输入时存在差异。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

### [79] [Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270)
*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理随时间变化的知识时的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级框架以解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，而现实世界信息不断变化，传统更新方法（如重新训练或上下文学习）成本高且不实用。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一种轻量级框架，通过外部记忆增量构建结构化知识。

Result: 该方法在复杂推理或冲突事实整合任务上优于基线方法（ICL和RAG）。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LLMs在处理动态知识时的挑战，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

TL;DR: 论文提出BiLingua Parser，一种基于LLM的标注工具，用于处理代码切换文本的句法分析，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境下代码切换文本的句法分析问题，填补现有方法在多语言和混合语言输入上的不足。

Method: 开发基于提示的框架，结合少量样本LLM提示和专家审核，生成西班牙语-英语和西班牙语-瓜拉尼语的UD标注。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29% LAS，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LLM在精心指导下可作为实用工具，为低资源代码切换环境提供句法资源。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战了‘随机鹦鹉’的类比，证明LLMs能理解语义而非仅记忆数据，且采样温度在模型推理中起关键作用。

Method: 系统评估了温度（0-2）对六种能力的影响，分析了三种规模的开源模型，并提出了BERT温度选择器。

Result: 发现温度对模型性能有技能特异性影响，BERT选择器显著提升中小模型性能，温度效应在FP16和4位量化模型中一致。

Conclusion: 温度选择复杂但关键，BERT选择器为实用解决方案，温度效应随模型规模变化。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Motivation: 桥接标注的主观性导致一致性难以达成，研究旨在探索这种主观性并改进标注方法。

Method: 在GUM语料库测试集上进行标注试验，提出新的桥接子类型分类系统，并与现有方案对比。

Result: 发现现有资源可能标注不足，桥接子类型标注一致性中等，但桥接实例识别一致性低。

Conclusion: 桥接标注的主观性显著，需改进标注框架以减少分歧。

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成事实性陈述时的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用ConfQA策略，结合“仅在自信时回答”提示和知识图谱校准信心，提出Dual Neural Knowledge框架。

Result: 幻觉率降至5%以下，准确率提升至95%以上，外部检索减少30%。

Conclusion: ConfQA和Dual Neural Knowledge框架有效减少幻觉并提升LLMs的事实准确性。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Motivation: 了解低资源机器翻译的实际需求，弥补传统调查方法的不足。

Method: 对Tetun语言MT服务tetun.org的10万条翻译请求进行观察性研究。

Conclusion: 低资源MT系统应关注教育相关领域的准确性，观察性研究能有效指导技术开发以满足实际需求。

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs
and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys
and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

Result: 发现模型间存在显著异质性、评分不对称性、对提示框架的敏感性及高频词过估值，并揭示了潜在的偏见问题。

Conclusion: 奖励模型并非完全可互换，且可能编码有害偏见，需谨慎用于下游任务。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演方法依赖提示工程，缺乏稳定性和可解释性。

Conclusion: SRPS能有效提升LLMs的推理能力，提供更好的可解释性和稳定性。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Motivation: 现有Finetuning-as-a-Service易因用户数据中的有害提示导致LLM安全对齐退化，需解决有害数据过滤问题。

Method: 通过安全对齐LLM提取拒绝特征，训练ReFT模型识别有害提示，并在微调中过滤和蒸馏对齐知识。

Result: 实验表明ReFT策略显著减少有害输出，同时提升任务微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为LLM微调服务提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Motivation: BIRD数据集假设用户具有专业知识和领域知识，这与文本到SQL的目标相矛盾，且人工生成的证据存在缺陷。

Method: SEED通过系统分析数据库模式、描述文件和值来自动生成证据。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider数据集上，SEED显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于BIRD提供的证据。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅弥合了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提高了模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Result: PiFi在多种自然语言处理任务中表现优异，提升了泛化能力和语言能力迁移。

Conclusion: PiFi成功结合了LLMs和SLMs的优势，为资源受限环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic

### [90] [Conjoined Predication and Scalar Implicature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07429)
*Ratna Kandala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Magri (2016) 研究了一个关于连词的未解之谜，揭示了量化、集体/并发解释与上下文更新之间的隐藏互动。本文通过理论框架分析，认为这种不协调源于连词谓语的集体或并发解读，并指出标量含义的语用机制超出了现有语法解释的范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Magri (2016) 提出的第一个未解之谜，即某些连词句子的不协调现象，并探讨其背后的语用机制。

Method: 通过理论框架分析，结合集体/并发解读和上下文矛盾，解释连词句子的不协调性。

Result: 发现不协调源于集体或并发解读导致的间接上下文矛盾，且标量含义的语用机制比现有语法解释更复杂。

Conclusion: 标量含义的语用机制需要更广泛的解释框架，现有语法理论未能完全涵盖其复杂性。

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

*Feifan Song,Shaohang Wei,Wen Luo,Yuxuan Fan,Tianyu Liu,Guoyin Wang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为弱到强解码（WSD）的新框架，通过小模型引导大模型生成对齐内容，解决了低资源对齐方法在高质量和对齐内容上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要与人类偏好对齐以避免生成冒犯性、虚假或无意义的内容。低资源对齐方法在获取高质量和对齐内容方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出WSD框架，利用小型对齐模型生成对齐的开头部分，再由大型基础模型继续生成剩余内容，并通过自动切换机制控制。使用新数据集GenerAlign微调小型Pilot-3B作为草案模型。

Result: WSD框架显著提升了不同基础模型的对齐能力，优于所有基线方法，同时避免了下游任务的性能下降（对齐税）。

Conclusion: WSD通过小型模型引导大型模型生成对齐内容，有效解决了低资源对齐的挑战，并通过实验验证了其高效性和内在机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于指令的统一框架，用于学习适用于信息检索（IR）和非IR任务的广义文本嵌入，结合上下文学习、软监督和自适应硬负样本挖掘，无需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本嵌入方法在多样任务中泛化能力不足的问题，同时避免任务特定微调的需求。

Method: 基于Mistral-7B模型，结合指令引导、软监督（连续相关性分数）和自适应硬负样本挖掘，生成上下文感知的嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB（英语v2）基准测试中表现优异，覆盖41个任务，排名靠前，优于更大或完全微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，可有效生成高质量、可扩展的文本嵌入。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，缺乏领域适应能力，导致主题推断不稳定且不连贯。

Method: 提出DALTA框架，结合共享编码器、专用解码器和对抗对齐，实现领域间选择性知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，DALTA在主题一致性、稳定性和可迁移性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALTA为低资源主题建模提供了一种有效的领域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KScope的分层框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的知识状态，并定义了五种知识状态分类。通过实验验证了上下文对知识更新的影响及其特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在知识冲突下的行为，但未能全面反映其对问题的真实知识掌握程度。

Method: 提出KScope框架，通过分层统计测试将LLM知识划分为五种状态，并在四个数据集上对九种LLM进行验证。

Result: 上下文支持缩小了模型间的知识差距；难度、相关性和熟悉度等特征影响知识更新；LLM在部分正确或冲突时表现相似，但在完全错误时差异显著。

Conclusion: 结合特征分析的上下文摘要和增强的可信度，可进一步提升知识更新的有效性，并适用于多种LLM。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM不确定性量化方法存在生态效度低、仅考虑认知不确定性及优化指标不实用的问题，并提出以用户为中心的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM在现实任务中的可靠性，通过改进不确定性量化方法增强用户对LLM预测的信任。

Method: 分析40种LLM不确定性量化方法，识别三大问题并提出用户中心化改进方向。

Result: 发现当前方法在生态效度、不确定性类型和优化指标上存在不足。

Conclusion: 建议LLM不确定性量化研究应更注重用户需求，采用人本主义方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

TL;DR: CCI4.0是一个大规模双语预训练数据集，包含高质量数据和多样化的人类推理轨迹，通过创新的数据处理流程提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决预训练数据质量动态变化的问题，并减少幻觉现象，需要一种更高效的数据处理方法和多样化的推理模板。

Method: 提出两阶段去重、多分类器质量评分和领域感知流畅性过滤的数据处理流程，并分阶段提取CoT模板。

Result: 实验表明，基于CCI4.0预训练的LLM在下游任务中表现更优，尤其在数学和代码任务上。

Conclusion: 严格的数据处理和人类推理模板对提升LLM性能至关重要，为自动处理预训练语料提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要中的公平性对决策至关重要，避免因偏向性摘要误导用户。

Method: 通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，并通过动态调整偏好对权重提升语料库级公平性。

Result: 实验表明FairPO在保持摘要质量的同时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPO有效提升了MDS的公平性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The
code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在严格约束下生成结构化内容时单一语言模型难以满足需求的问题。

Method: 将输出视为基因，利用语言模型指导遗传算法的选择、交叉和变异操作。

Result: 在行程规划、学术大纲和商业报告等任务中表现优异，满足约束并生成高质量结果。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合两种技术的优势，显著提升了生成任务的效果和适应性。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Motivation: 语音消歧（DTS）研究不足，缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 构建DEBATE数据集，包含1,001条歧义语句，每条由10位母语者录制，分析语音线索。

Result: 实验显示机器与人类在语音意图理解上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: DEBATE为跨语言和文化的DTS研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

Method: 进行全国性调查，收集本土语言社区的需求和意见。

Result: 机器翻译和信息检索是主要需求，但隐私和偏见问题需解决。

Conclusion: 需透明沟通以支持AI技术在本土语言中的广泛应用。

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI
adoption.

Conclusion: DeRAGEC在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了ASR系统的命名实体纠正性能。

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

Motivation: 现有LLM生成的事后解释往往与真实决策过程不一致，缺乏系统性解决方案，且评估成本高。

Method: 引入PSCB基准，分析解释的自我一致性，提出新度量标准，并通过DPO优化LLM。

Result: 发现自我一致性分数在正确与错误预测间差异不大，新度量标准更有效，DPO显著提升了匹配度。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更可信、自我一致的LLM提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号时会导致序列长度显著增加，影响计算效率。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无损压缩技术。

Result: 减少了序列长度，提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该技术为解决字节级回退带来的计算效率问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种无需外部奖励模型的方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: 提出SELT框架，利用改进的MCTS算法，结合LLM的自我评估能力，将推理过程分解为原子子任务并进行语义聚类。

Result: 在MMLU和Seal-Tools等基准测试中，SELT显著提高了答案准确性和推理鲁棒性，且无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: SELT是一种通用性强、无需外部奖励模型的LLM推理增强框架，适用于多样化推理任务。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application

settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation
with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

Conclusion: 在低资源语言中，结合语料库和合成指令的方法可行且高效，为未来研究提供了代码、模型和数据集支持。

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

*Peyman Rostami,Vahid Rahimzadeh,Ali Adibi,Azadeh Shakery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对2024年美国总统选举的立场检测数据集PolitiSky24，基于新兴平台Bluesky，聚焦于Kamala Harris和Donald Trump，包含16,044个用户-目标立场对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测数据集多集中于推文级别，而用户级别的立场资源稀缺，尤其是在新兴平台如Bluesky上。用户级别立场能提供更全面的视角。

Method: 采用结合高级信息检索和大语言模型的标注流程，生成立场标签并提供支持理由和文本片段，标注准确率达81%。

Result: 数据集包含用户发布历史、互动图和参与元数据，填补了政治立场分析在时效性、开放性和用户级别视角上的空白。

Conclusion: PolitiSky24为政治立场分析提供了及时、开放且用户级别的资源，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次尝试将大语言模型（LLMs）适配到乌克兰方言（Hutsul），通过构建平行语料库和词典，并利用RAG生成合成数据，最终微调模型并验证其优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源、形态复杂方言的机器翻译问题。

Method: 构建平行语料库和词典，提出RAG生成合成数据，微调开源LLMs（使用LoRA），并与GPT-4o对比。

Result: 微调的小模型（7B）在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和微调，小模型在低资源方言翻译任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoRMA的新方法，通过矩阵乘法变换替代传统的加法更新，解决了计算复杂性和秩瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全微调大语言模型计算成本高，现有方法如LoRA采用加法更新，限制了适应性。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA)，通过矩阵乘法变换和秩膨胀策略优化计算。

Result: 实验证明LoRMA在多项评估指标中表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRMA为高效适应大语言模型提供了新思路，优于传统加法更新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在智能辅导系统中缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需要任务特定适配。

Method: 使用包含11种教学意图的细粒度标注框架重新标注MathDial数据集，并微调大语言模型。

Result: 细粒度模型生成的响应在教学对齐性和有效性上优于原始四分类模型。

Conclusion: 教学意图的细粒度标注对教育场景中的可控文本生成具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉语言模型生成段落的事实准确性方法存在不足，缺乏细粒度错误检测和验证数据集。

Method: 引入DOCCI-Critique基准（1,400段落标注）和VNLI-Critique模型，用于句子级事实分类和错误分析。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异，AutoRater与人类评分高度一致，Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升段落准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为细粒度评估提供了关键工具，推动了VLM图像理解的改进。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助论文评审时难以兼顾全面性和效率，因此需要一种更高效且深入的评审方法。

Method: TreeReview通过递归分解高层次问题为细粒度子问题，构建评审问题树，并通过动态问题扩展机制生成后续问题，最终从叶到根聚合答案生成评审。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在全面性和深度上优于基线方法，同时减少了80%的LLM令牌使用量。

Conclusion: TreeReview提供了一种高效且深入的论文评审方法，适用于生成全面且专家对齐的评审反馈。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言（如波兰语）中易受字符和词级攻击，导致预测结果大幅改变，揭示了其安全机制的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多语言任务中表现优异，但其安全训练数据主要集中于高资源语言（如英语），导致低资源语言中的漏洞未被充分评估。

Method: 通过修改少量字符并使用小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建低成本攻击方法，并在波兰语中验证其有效性。

Result: 攻击显著改变了LLM的预测结果，表明其安全机制存在漏洞，且该方法可扩展至其他语言。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在低资源语言中的安全风险，并提供了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量标注，适用于日语TTS数据集构建。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的领域特定模型评估方法，并为高效微调和减轻灾难性遗忘提供了新见解。

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集有望为未来提升LLM推理能力的研究做出贡献。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究在线平台自动审核系统的有效性，特别是针对实时互动内容的审核需求。

Method: 通过创建测试账户，使用Twitch API发送超过107,000条仇恨内容评论，评估AutoMod的标记准确性。

Result: AutoMod漏检高达94%的仇恨内容，但对含敏感词的良性内容误判率高达89.5%。

Conclusion: AutoMod在上下文理解上存在重大缺陷，需改进以更有效识别仇恨内容并减少误判。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Method: 构建包含2366个多样化问题的基准，标注超过35K个基础段落，评估LLMs在识别相关信息和提供偏转响应时的表现。

Result: LLMs倾向于过度总结而非严格基于相关段落生成答案，且在无相关信息时偏转响应能力有限（最高31%）。

Conclusion: GaRAGe揭示了LLMs在RAG任务中的局限性，尤其是在处理时效性问题和稀疏基础来源时表现较差。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器训练方法主要针对基础模型，应用于指令模型时效果不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出FAST方法，通过调整训练过程以匹配指令模型的数据分布和激活模式。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上，FAST的重构误差显著低于基线方法；在Llama3.2-3B-Instruct上，高质量特征比例更高。

Conclusion: FAST为指令模型提供了更好的稀疏自编码器训练方案，并揭示了通过干预特殊令牌激活改进模型行为的新机会。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索长链思维监督对小语言模型性能的影响，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 通过在Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3系列模型上进行实验，分析长CoT训练对SLMs的影响。

Result: 实验表明，SLMs在长CoT训练中性能显著下降，甚至无法恢复原始性能，归因于错误累积。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了长CoT训练对小模型的普遍假设，并为构建更有效的小规模推理模型提供指导。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种标准化的多语言语法错误标注框架，结合语言无关基础和语言特定扩展，支持多语言GEC标注和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架（如errant）在多语言扩展时存在局限性，需要一种更灵活且一致的方法。

Method: 结合语言无关基础和语言特定扩展，使用stanza重新实现errant以支持多语言覆盖，并在多种语言中验证。

Result: 框架适用于英语、德语、捷克语、韩语和中文，支持从通用标注到定制化语言细化。

Conclusion: 该框架支持多语言GEC标注的扩展性和可解释性，促进多语言环境下更一致的评估。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

TL;DR: 论文介绍了瑞士议会语料库的长篇版本，通过Whisper和GPT-4o的结合优化语音文本对齐，提升了质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为低资源、领域特定的语音语料库提供高质量的长篇语音文本对齐数据。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3转录音频，并通过两步GPT-4o修正和过滤低质量片段。

Result: 最终语料库包含801小时音频，其中751小时通过质量控制，BLEU分数提升6点。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM修正和数据驱动过滤，显著提升了语料库质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）提升语言模型抽象推理能力的方法AbstraL，以应对分布变化带来的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在分布变化（如数值或名义变量变化、干扰性条款插入）时推理能力不稳健的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习而非监督微调，通过抽象化推理问题来提升模型的稳健性，并与符号工具结合。

Result: AbstraL方法显著减轻了在GSM扰动基准测试中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象化推理问题并通过强化学习训练，能有效提升语言模型在分布变化下的稳健性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）遗忘技术的局限性，提出了形式依赖偏差问题，并引入ORT基准和ROCR方法以提升遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在实际应用中效果有限，主要问题在于其依赖训练样本的形式，难以泛化到不同表达形式的知识。

Method: 论文提出ORT基准量化形式依赖偏差，并引入ROCR方法，通过重定向激活的危险概念实现快速遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，ROCR显著优于传统方法，能高效且自然地完成遗忘任务。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘应具备形式独立性，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签选择和加权的挑战，结合现有技术提升鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 采用三重重伪标签加权模块，结合头部一致性、自适应阈值和平均伪边际技术。

Result: 在5个NLP数据集的10个设置中，9个达到最优，且在数据不平衡情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: MultiMatch在SSL中表现优异，尤其在数据不平衡任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Conclusion: WebUIBench为多模态大语言模型在Web开发中的能力评估提供了系统框架，有助于指导模型优化。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出LeaF框架，通过干预式推理解决LLMs在长上下文推理中的注意力分散问题，显著提升推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在长上下文推理中容易因训练数据中的虚假相关性而分心，导致推理冗余和错误生成。

Method: LeaF采用两阶段框架：1）基于梯度的教师模型识别混淆标记；2）通过蒸馏修剪这些标记以对齐注意力分布。

Result: 实验表明LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中表现优异，同时抑制了对混淆标记的关注。

Conclusion: LeaF有效提升了LLMs的推理能力和生成可靠性，为模型注意力机制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

TL;DR: MEMOIR是一种新型的可扩展框架，通过残差记忆模块注入知识，避免干扰先前的编辑，并支持大规模连续编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在实时更新知识时面临的效率、可靠性和遗忘问题。

Method: 使用残差记忆模块和样本依赖的稀疏掩码，将每次编辑限制在记忆参数的一个子集上，减少编辑间的干扰。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正和分布外泛化等任务中，MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化性和局部性方面表现优异，支持数千次连续编辑。

Conclusion: MEMOIR为语言模型的高效、可靠编辑提供了可行方案，适用于大规模知识更新。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Result: MiniCPM4在多个基准测试中优于同类开源模型，处理长序列时速度显著提升。

Conclusion: MiniCPM4高效且多功能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

Motivation: 量子机器学习在复杂结构化数据建模中具有潜力，但现有量子自然语言处理模型在效率和表达能力上仍有不足。

Method: QGT通过参数化量子电路（PQCs）实现量子自注意力机制，并将其整合到基于图的消息传递框架中。

Result: QGT在五个情感分类基准测试中表现优于或与现有量子模型相当，相比经典图变换器平均准确率提升5.42%（真实数据集）和4.76%（合成数据集），且样本效率提高50%。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效比较LLM输出的变化，尤其是在随机性和计算复杂性限制下。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛采样构建低维语义相似空间的零假设和备择假设分布，实现可处理的推断。

Result: 框架具有模型无关性、支持任意输入扰动、提供可解释p值等优势，并通过案例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM审计提供了一种可靠的频率假设检验方法。

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Motivation: 当前语言模型对非规范标记编码分配了非零概率，这不仅错误且浪费概率质量，需要纠正。

Method: 提出两种方法：(1) 通过条件化在推理时确保规范标记；(2) 通过构造化在模型参数中保证规范输出。

Result: 实验表明，纠正非规范标记问题能提高模型在测试数据上的似然性。

Conclusion: 确保标记的规范性可以显著提升语言模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

Motivation: 探讨多样性是否真正减少了LLMs的同质性，以及不同LLMs之间的差异是否显著。

Method: 对超过350个LLMs进行大规模实证评估，使用两个流行的排行榜和一个简历筛选任务。

Result: 发现模型错误高度相关，尤其是在更大、更准确的模型中，即使架构和提供者不同。

Conclusion: 模型错误的相关性在下游任务（如LLM-as-judge评估和招聘）中产生显著影响，反映了算法单一化的理论预测。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的语言模型预训练扩展范式。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

Conclusion: DigitalShadow为CAD早期检测提供了高效、隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a

*Rifat Sadik,Tanvir Rahman,Arpan Bhattacharjee,Bikash Chandra Halder,Ismail Hossain*

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉变换器（ViTs）在皮肤医学图像中对对抗性水印攻击的脆弱性，并探讨了对抗训练作为防御机制的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViTs在计算机视觉任务中的成功应用，研究其在医学图像中对对抗性攻击的脆弱性具有重要意义。

Method: 通过投影梯度下降（PGD）生成对抗性水印，测试ViTs和CNNs的脆弱性，并分析对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗性攻击非常脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练可显著提升性能（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中对对抗性攻击敏感，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB智能手机摄像头的远程健身追踪系统，解决了现有方法在运动多样性和实际部署中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健身追踪模型要么运动种类有限，要么过于复杂，难以实际应用。

Method: 开发了一个多任务运动分析模型，结合大规模数据集Olympia（包含1900多种运动），利用视觉-语言模型进行运动检测和重复计数。

Result: 模型在Olympia数据集上运动检测准确率为76.5%，重复计数准确率为85.3%。

Conclusion: 通过单一视觉-语言模型实现健身追踪，推动了AI在健身领域的普及。

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

*Mingqi Jiang,Chanho Kim,Chen Ziwen,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅（GS）的通用语义SLAM算法，通过学习的通用网络从RGB-D视频流增量构建和更新3D场景表示，解决了现有GS-SLAM方法依赖场景优化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM算法在相机跟踪方面表现优异，但生成的3D地图分辨率低且不完整；现有GS-SLAM方法依赖场景优化，耗时长且泛化能力差。

Method: 使用RGB-D图像识别主干预测高斯参数，集成3D语义分割，并通过全局定位后仅优化1次高斯泼溅来修正定位漂移和浮点。

Result: 在ScanNet基准测试中实现最先进的语义SLAM性能，高斯数量比其他GS方法少一个数量级，并在NYUv2和TUM RGB-D数据集上展示零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过通用网络和高效优化策略，显著提升了GS-SLAM的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: 多模态模型整合对精细视听分割有效。

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

Motivation: 确保DNN在交通标志识别中的安全性，防止训练数据被篡改或中毒。

Method: 通过误差最小化攻击测试DNN鲁棒性，提出基于数据增强的训练方法，并设计检测模型识别中毒数据。

Result: 攻击使DNN准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，提出的方法恢复至96.05%，检测模型识别成功率超99%。

Conclusion: 需采用先进训练方法提升DNN在交通标志识别中的抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: RGB图像结合现代深度学习技术可用于纺织品回收的关键预处理任务。

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

Motivation: 现有监控系统因图像质量低和数据集偏差导致人脸识别性能下降，尤其在肤色变化和部分遮挡情况下。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上验证，平台显著提升了训练数据多样性和模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究减少了AI面部分析的偏差，提升了监控系统在复杂环境中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

TL;DR: EV-LayerSegNet是一种自监督CNN，用于基于事件的运动分割，通过分层场景动态表示学习光流和分割掩码，并以去模糊质量作为自监督损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄像头在运动任务中表现有限，事件相机虽能高分辨率捕捉动态，但获取真实标签昂贵且困难，需要自监督方法。

Method: 提出EV-LayerSegNet，通过分层动态表示分别学习仿射光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。

Result: 在仅含仿射运动的模拟数据集上，IoU和检测率分别达到71%和87%。

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet展示了自监督方法在事件相机运动分割任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言模型在泛化性、透明度和计算效率方面存在局限，阻碍了其在真实资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 采用低秩适应和自定义奖励函数对轻量级基础模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct进行微调，训练在单块NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU上完成。

Result: RARL在医疗图像分析和临床推理任务中显著优于监督微调，推理任务性能提升约7.78%，且在未见数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 推理引导学习和推理提示能有效提升医疗视觉语言模型的透明度、准确性和资源效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本CIR在FashionIQ基准上表现不佳的问题，探索更有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: 1. 使用BLIP-2和轻量级Q-Former进行视觉-文本特征融合；2. 尝试Retrieval-DPO方法，但效果不佳。

Result: BLIP-2方法将Recall@10提升至45.6%（衬衫）、40.1%（裙子）和50.4%（上衣），平均Recall@50达67.6%。Retrieval-DPO方法仅0.02% Recall@10。

Conclusion: 有效的CIR需要多模态融合、排名感知目标和高质量负样本。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

Conclusion: PhysLab有望推动细粒度视觉解析和智能课堂系统的发展，促进计算机视觉与教育技术的融合。

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有深度从散焦（DFD）技术通常依赖多张图像，而单张散焦图像的深度估计问题因约束不足而少有研究。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用局部散焦模糊与对比度变化的关系作为关键深度线索，并通过对抗训练实现端到端的深度估计。

Result: 实验表明，结合暗通道先验的单图像DFD方法能有效估计深度。

Conclusion: 暗通道先验的引入显著提升了单图像DFD的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense是一种深度学习框架，专为洪水灾害后的建筑损坏评估设计，融合多模态数据并显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水灾害后的建筑损坏识别中表现不佳，因洪水通常不会留下明显的光谱或结构特征。

Method: 结合SAR/InSAR、高分辨率光学图像和洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构和半Siamese编码器，联合预测损坏状态、洪水范围和建筑轮廓。

Result: 在Harris County的测试中，F1分数比现有方法提升19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损坏类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR的全天候能力，提供更快、更精细的洪水损坏评估，支持灾后决策。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation
metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly
updated. Project page: https://github.com/nqian1/Survey-on-ODISR-and-ODVSR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于双曲平均曲率流的主动轮廓模型（HMCF-ACMs）和双模式正则化流驱动的主动轮廓模型（HDRF-ACMs），通过可调初始速度场和边缘感知力调制，提升了图像分割的精度和抗噪性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抛物线平均曲率流驱动的主动轮廓模型（PMCF-ACMs）对初始曲线配置依赖性强，限制了其适应性。本文旨在通过引入双曲平均曲率流和优化算法，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs，利用水平集方法和带符号距离函数建立数值等效性，并优化加权四阶Runge-Kutta算法求解波动方程。

Result: 实验表明，HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs在噪声抑制和数值稳定性方面表现优异，能实现更精确的分割。

Conclusion: 通过任务自适应的初始速度和轮廓配置，HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs显著提升了图像分割性能。

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类与野生动物冲突需要准确识别潜在威胁物种，但现有模型在未知类别上表现不佳，因此研究OOD检测。

Method: 采用参数化的最近类均值（NCM）和非参数化的对比学习方法，利用预训练特征，并与文献中的OOD方法对比。

Result: 基于特征的方法（如NCM）在AUPR-IN、AUPR-OUT和AUTC指标上分别提升2%、4%和22%。

Conclusion: 特征方法在野生动物OOD检测中表现更优，为缓解人兽冲突提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

<details>

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉与语言融合方面取得了显著成功，但仍存在幻觉现象，即输出看似合理但与图像内容不符。

Method: 提出了一种简单且无需训练的推理解码方法LPS，利用局部视觉先验信息作为值函数来修正解码过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现突出。

Conclusion: LPS是一种即插即用的方法，兼容多种模型，能有效抑制幻觉现象，尤其在噪声场景下效果显著。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注3D表面重建或局部几何特征提取，忽视了结构建模在捕获语义信息中的作用。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从SAR图像中直接获取目标语义结构信息，为SAR高级信息检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Conclusion: LitMAS为多模态生物识别系统提供了一种轻量级、通用的反欺骗解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)外推提供了一种通用且几何结构保持的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高风格保真度和身份完整性方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或微调，即可在复杂场景中实现高质量的风格迁移和身份保留。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: 在多个COS基准测试中达到最优分割效果，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD无需训练即可显著提升分割精度和效率，适用于伪装目标分割任务。

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 实验表明Hi-LSplat在3D开放词汇分割和定位中表现优异，尤其在层次语义数据集上。

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat有效解决了视角不一致和层次语义问题，提升了3D场景的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Result: 实验表明PBL能有效继承源模型的鲁棒性，并显著提升VP在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PBL策略在多种数据集上表现出普遍适用性，为VP在鲁棒源模型下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在背景耦合、文本对齐和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了背景耦合与对象灵活性的平衡。

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Conclusion: EndoARSS有望推动AI驱动的内窥镜手术系统发展，提升手术安全与效率。

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

### [167] [Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06836)
*Zelin He,Sarah Alnegheimish,Matthew Reimherr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法，结合ViT4TS和VLM4TS，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家一样识别上下文异常。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：ViT4TS定位候选异常，VLM4TS结合全局时间上下文和VLM推理能力优化检测。

Result: VLM4TS在未进行时间序列训练的情况下，F1-max得分比最佳基线提高24.6%，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，展现了VLM在时间序列异常检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Multi-StyleGS的新方法，用于在3D高斯泼溅（GS）场景中实现多风格匹配，同时保持内存高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D GS在匹配多风格时的挑战，包括自动局部风格转移和手动指定风格，同时保持内存效率。

Method: 采用二分匹配机制自动识别风格图像与渲染图像局部区域的对应关系，提出语义风格损失函数和局部-全局特征匹配以增强多视角一致性。

Result: 方法在实验中表现优于现有技术，生成更合理的风格化结果并提供灵活编辑。

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS是一种高效且灵活的3D GS风格化解决方案，适用于多风格匹配和编辑。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统惯性运动捕捉系统依赖复杂模型和昂贵软件，研究旨在通过神经网络简化流程并降低成本。

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick方法表现最佳，误差为7.96。

Conclusion: 神经网络在姿态估计上可与现有融合滤波器媲美，具有潜力。

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

*John Waithaka,Moise Busogi*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法（LOCA），用于多模态卫星图像语义分割，显著优于现有的基于重建的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像的语义分割对地球观测应用至关重要，但受限于标记训练数据的不足。现有的自监督预训练方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的基础。

Method: 通过扩展SatMAE的通道分组至多模态数据，并引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互，同时采用相对补丁位置预测任务以增强空间推理能力。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水映射数据集上，该方法显著优于现有的基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对多模态卫星图像适配的位置预测任务，能学习到比基于重建的方法更有效的表示，适用于卫星图像语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要预测其他代理的运动，现有编码器-解码器模型存在信息滞后问题，DONUT通过单自回归模型实现一致预测。

Method: 使用解码器网络DONUT，结合历史轨迹编码和自回归预测，引入‘过预测’策略以提升长期预测能力。

Result: DONUT在Argoverse 2单代理运动预测基准测试中表现优于基线模型，达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: 仅解码器模型DONUT在轨迹预测中表现优异，未来可进一步优化多代理场景。

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法仅从策略模型本身采样动作组，限制了模型的推理能力上限并导致训练效率低下。

Method: 提出Vision-EKIPL框架，在强化学习训练过程中引入外部辅助模型生成的高质量动作，以指导策略模型的优化。

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL克服了传统强化学习方法的局限性，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉推理性能，为该领域研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

Motivation: 由于传感器不完善，原始点云常含大量噪声，影响3D人脸识别效果。

Method: 设计cGAN-TOP去噪点云并恢复特征，采用LDGCNN进行多尺度特征链接的人脸识别。

Result: 在Bosphorus数据集上验证，所有噪声设置下识别精度显著提升，最高增益14.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声点云下的3D人脸识别问题。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Result: 在Saliency4ASD数据集上测试，模型表现优异（准确率0.96，F1分数0.95，灵敏度0.97，特异性0.94）。

Conclusion: 该模型为资源有限或偏远地区的ASD筛查提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early

Vision Transformers (ViT) and Vision Mamba to detect ASD using eye-tracking

TL;DR: NSD-Imagery是一个新发布的基准数据集，用于评估fMRI到图像重建模型在心理图像上的表现，补充了现有的NSD数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理图像的重建在医学和脑机接口领域有重要应用，但现有模型仅针对视觉图像进行了评估，缺乏对心理图像的重建能力研究。

Method: 通过NSD-Imagery数据集，评估了多种NSD训练的视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等）在心理图像上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，模型在心理图像上的表现与视觉图像重建表现脱节，简单线性架构和多模态特征解码模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法的改进提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在3D点云数据分析中表现出色，但其对对抗攻击（如点丢弃、移动和添加）的脆弱性威胁了3D视觉系统的可靠性。现有防御机制对此类攻击效果不佳。

Method: KNN-Defense基于流形假设和特征空间的最近邻搜索，通过恢复受扰动输入而非重建表面几何或强制均匀点分布，实现了轻量且高效的计算。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，KNN-Defense显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，尤其在点丢弃攻击中，对PointNet、PointNet++、DGCNN和PCT的准确率分别提升了20.1%、3.6%、3.44%和7.74%。

Conclusion: KNN-Defense是一种可扩展且有效的解决方案，能够增强3D点云分类器的对抗鲁棒性，适用于实时和实际应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at
https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅技术在动态场景中主要局限于静态或短期动态，长期动态（场景在视野外演化）的研究较少，且几何和语义一致性维护存在挑战。

Method: 引入动态场景适应机制持续更新3D表示，并提出关键帧管理机制以丢弃过时观测同时保留信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，提出的GaME方法比现有技术更准确。

Conclusion: GaME方法有效解决了长期动态场景的挑战，提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的性能。

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PSG依赖EEG，复杂且不适合家庭监测，因此研究使用EOG和PSM作为替代方案。

Method: 利用ImageBind模型整合PSM和双通道EOG数据，首次将两者结合用于睡眠分类。

Result: 模型在未微调时表现优异，微调后进一步超越现有单模态和多模态方法。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型可有效用于睡眠分期，接近依赖EEG的复杂系统。

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Result: 在低光环境下成功读取文本，带宽消耗比RGB相机低2400倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了智能眼镜在复杂环境中的文本识别能力，同时大幅降低带宽需求。

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

Motivation: 探讨Video LLMs在时间推理上的能力，以及当前视频训练方法的效率问题。

Method: 使用LongVU算法训练LLMs，并通过TVBench评估其时间推理能力；提出基于标注图像序列的简单微调方案。

Result: 图像训练的LLMs在时间推理任务上表现显著高于随机水平，且接近或优于视频训练的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前模型未能充分利用视频中的时间特征，需进一步研究图像训练LLMs的时间推理机制及视频训练瓶颈。

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，但现有LiDAR处理方法存在延迟高或性能下降的问题。

Conclusion: PHiM为流式LiDAR检测提供了高效、高性能的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

Conclusion: LaTtE-Flow高效统一了图像理解与生成，适合实时或资源受限场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Result: 在模拟和真实文档数据集上验证，提高了文本检测性能（IoU指标）并保持图像保真度。

Conclusion: 多目标优化有助于缩小模拟训练与实际部署之间的差距。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: AR-RAG是一种新的图像生成方法，通过自回归方式在生成过程中动态检索和整合最相关的视觉参考，避免了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在生成前进行一次静态检索，导致过复制或风格偏差等问题。AR-RAG旨在通过动态检索提升生成质量。

Method: 提出了两种框架：DAiD（训练自由的解码策略）和FAiD（参数高效的微调方法），分别通过分布和特征增强优化生成过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（如Midjourney-30K、GenEval和DPG-Bench），AR-RAG显著优于现有图像生成模型。

Conclusion: AR-RAG通过动态检索和增强策略，有效提升了图像生成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

Result: 实验证明融合策略显著提升了识别性能，但序列到序列模型难以从双视角视频中学习互补特征。

Conclusion: 双视角数据集和基线模型有效，但需进一步研究多视角特征融合方法。

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

Motivation: CLIP存在模态鸿沟问题，现有MLLM虽具备对齐能力但机制较粗糙，限制了潜力。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，通过强化学习实现细粒度对齐，包括自动偏好数据构建和RPA损失函数。

Result: 实验表明MAPLE在细粒度跨模态检索中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过细粒度对齐机制有效解决了跨模态检索中的语义区分问题。

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Conclusion: 混合表示方法在室内场景中实现了高效且高质量的渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Result: 实验表明COGO显著提高了对抗攻击的迁移成功率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COGO通过优化共享和抑制个体特征，有效提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: BePo有效结合BEV和稀疏点，提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that

deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a

Result: 模型在检测AI生成图像和定位视觉缺陷方面表现优异，显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了检测性能，还实现了可解释的视觉-文本对齐推理。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法精度低，而微波和雷达方法范围有限，因此需要开发一种能实现高精度全盘反演的红外方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 扫描带蒸馏阶段，通过CoMWE技术将多模态知识迁移到红外模型；2) 全盘适应阶段，利用Self-MaskTune平衡多模态和红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中表现优异，超越了PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等领先产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net显著提升了红外降水反演的精度和范围，为实时降水监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

TL;DR: LSSKD框架通过自监督知识蒸馏训练紧凑模型，无需预训练教师网络，性能优于现有方法且无额外计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练教师网络，而LSSKD旨在通过自监督知识提升模型性能，适用于低计算设备。

Method: 在中间特征图上附加辅助分类器，生成多样化自监督知识，实现跨网络阶段的一对一知识迁移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet上性能优于PS-KD和SSKD，Tiny ImageNet和CIFAR-100小样本学习中也达到最优。

Conclusion: LSSKD有效提升模型泛化性能，适用于多模态感知和低计算环境，支持弱监督下的智能代理开发。

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标模型的损失函数引导和对抗样本生成协作性方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 提出D2R Loss（包含对抗分布和干净分布优化）和CAG策略（基于梯度的协作对抗生成）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny ImageNet等数据集上验证，D2R Loss结合CAG显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率地球观测数据量大且异构带来的处理和标注挑战。

Method: 使用六种对齐模态数据（如航空影像、Sentinel-1/2时间序列等），评估多模态融合和深度学习模型（CNN、transformer）。

Result: 最佳土地覆盖分类性能为78.2%准确率和65.8% mIoU，几乎使用了所有模态数据。

Conclusion: FLAIR-HUB为土地覆盖和作物分类提供了高质量数据集，展示了多模态融合的潜力。

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal
pretraining, with data and code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态伪标签学习的无监督伪装目标检测方法（UCOD-DPL），通过自适应伪标签模块、双分支对抗解码器和二次观察机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督伪装目标检测方法因伪标签噪声大和解码器简单，导致性能较低，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合自适应伪标签模块（APM）、双分支对抗解码器（DBA）和二次观察机制（Look-Twice），动态优化伪标签并提升特征学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至超过部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL通过动态伪标签学习和复杂解码器设计，有效解决了无监督伪装目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在室内场景合成中存在编辑限制、物理不连贯、人力需求高、单房间限制和材质质量差等问题。

Result: 实验验证SceneLCM优于现有技术，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Conclusion: SceneLCM通过模块化设计和优化技术，显著提升了室内场景生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

Motivation: 工业面板文本检测存在跨尺度定位和密集文本区域边界模糊的挑战，现有方法多关注单一文本形状，缺乏多尺度特征的综合探索。

Method: 开发了一种新型Transformer结构，结合高效混合器学习多级特征间的依赖关系，并设计了基于Catmull-Rom样条的特征采样方法。

Result: 在自建的工业面板监控数据集（IPM）上验证了方法的优越性能，实际测试证明了其实用性。

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter在工业面板监控任务中表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

TL;DR: Hi-VAE是一种高效的视频自编码框架，通过分层编码视频动态的粗到细运动表示，显著提高了压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自编码方法未能高效建模时空冗余，导致压缩效率低下和训练成本高昂。

Method: Hi-VAE将视频动态分解为全局运动和详细运动两个潜在空间，并使用条件扩散解码器重建视频。

Result: 实验显示Hi-VAE压缩因子达1428倍，远超基线方法（如Cosmos-VAE的48倍），同时保持高质量重建。

Conclusion: Hi-VAE在高效压缩和高质量重建方面表现优异，为视频潜在表示和生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）因计算成本高和视觉令牌序列的二次复杂性面临挑战，需优化令牌处理。

Method: 提出STF融合空间相邻令牌，MBTF补充多粒度特征，平衡令牌减少与信息保留。

Result: 在8个视觉语言基准测试中，仅使用25%的视觉令牌即达到或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF模块有效提升推理效率，同时保持多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法仅依赖模型到帧注册，GoTrack通过结合帧到帧注册节省计算并稳定跟踪。

Method: 使用标准神经网络块（基于DINOv2的Transformer）实现模型到帧注册，轻量级光流模型实现帧到帧注册。

Result: GoTrack与现有粗姿态估计方法结合，在标准6DoF姿态估计与跟踪基准上达到RGB-only的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GoTrack提供了一种高效、准确的6DoF姿态跟踪解决方案，代码与模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source
code and trained models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于ORB的SLAM系统在移动平台上难以满足实时处理需求，主要因Oriented FAST计算耗时。

Method: 优化FAST特征点检测和Harris角点检测，采用二进制编码策略和可分离Harris检测策略。

Result: 在Jetson TX2上实验显示，相比OpenCV GPU版本，平均加速7.3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在移动和资源受限环境中具有高效性和实时应用潜力。

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance 是一种高效、无需训练的可控视频生成方法，兼容任何视频模型。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估手术动作规划任务所需的复杂能力，尤其是在生命关键领域中的精确性和可验证性。

Method: 提出SAP-Bench数据集，包含1,226个临床验证的手术动作片段，并开发MLLM-SAP框架，利用MLLMs生成下一步动作建议。

Result: 评估了七种先进MLLMs，发现其在下一步动作预测任务中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench和MLLM-SAP为手术动作规划提供了有效的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过挖掘难负样本和建模细粒度语义相似性，显著提升了文本-视频检索的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的跨模态后门攻击方法BadSem，利用语义不匹配作为隐式触发器，攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs）。实验表明其攻击成功率高达98%，且防御策略难以应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖单模态触发器，未充分探索VLMs的跨模态融合特性。本文旨在填补这一空白，揭示语义漏洞。

Method: 提出BadSem攻击，通过故意错配图像-文本对在训练中植入后门，并构建SIMBad数据集支持语义操纵。

Result: BadSem在四种VLMs上平均攻击成功率达98%，且能泛化到分布外数据。防御策略（系统提示和监督微调）均无效。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了VLMs中语义漏洞的严重性，呼吁更安全的部署方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异上仍存在幻觉或语义遗漏问题，主要源于训练数据和目标函数的局限性。

Method: 提出可控数据生成流程构建MED数据集（50K图像-文本对），并设计监督微调框架，结合特征级一致性损失优化模型。

Conclusion: 结合针对性数据和目标对齐能有效增强MLLMs的细粒度视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态视觉标记编码，无法动态适应或迭代优化推理过程，与人类感知的动态性形成对比。

Method: 提出基于马尔可夫决策过程的框架，结合提议视觉动作的推理器和通过多步直接偏好优化（DPO）训练的验证器，支持迭代推理。

Result: 方法在多个视觉推理基准上显著优于现有方法，提高了准确性和推理过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: 首次证明归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Result: 模型在从低层视觉（如分割）到高层推理（如ARC-AGI）的多样化任务中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VDMs不仅是生成引擎，还是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）在每步去噪中仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复的保真度和鲁棒性。

Method: 在每步去噪时间步中引入多步优化策略，提升图像质量、感知准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，增加每步梯度更新次数可显著改善LPIPS和PSNR，且在Jetson Orin Nano上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MPGD作为一种轻量级即插即用模块，适用于无人机和移动机器人等实时视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such

Conclusion: FANVID旨在促进低分辨率时间建模的创新，适用于监控、法医和自动驾驶等领域。

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

Motivation: 现有点跟踪方法无法提供高分辨率和密集对应场，而现有光流方法仅能对应下一帧。AllTracker旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合光流和点跟踪技术，通过低分辨率网格迭代推断，利用2D卷积层和像素对齐注意力层进行时空信息传播。

Result: 模型参数高效（1600万参数），在高分辨率（768x1024像素）下实现最先进的点跟踪精度。

Conclusion: AllTracker通过结合多种技术，实现了高效、高精度的长距离点跟踪，并在训练数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

Motivation: 显著性方法常用于可视化模型预测的相关输入特征，但其视觉合理性可能掩盖关键局限性。本文旨在评估这些方法是否能区分同一输入上的不同类别标签。

Method: 提出了一种诊断测试（class sensitivity），并通过实验验证了许多显著性方法对类别标签不敏感。随后，提出了一种新的对比解释方法CASE，通过隔离对预测类别唯一具有区分性的特征来生成解释。

Result: 实验表明，许多广泛使用的显著性方法对类别标签不敏感，而CASE方法在诊断测试和基于扰动的保真度测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显著性方法的类别不敏感性是结构性问题，而非模型特定问题。CASE方法能够生成更忠实且类别特定的解释。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Result: 在模拟IIN基准测试中达到最先进性能，并具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的分层评分范式显著提升了IIN任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

*Satvik Praveen,Yoonsung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合TPS和CBAM的改进YOLO模型，用于农业中的植物检测，解决了遮挡和非刚性变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统YOLO模型在农业场景中因遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声导致检测精度下降，STN的仿射变换无法处理非刚性变形。

Method: 结合TPS的STN实现非刚性空间变换，并引入CBAM模块抑制噪声、增强特征。

Result: 在PGP数据集上，模型在精度、召回率和mAP上优于STN-YOLO，假阳性减少12%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型提升了空间感知能力，适用于实时边缘部署，适合精准农业需求。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在多目标图像上表现不佳，MOS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过拼接单目标图像生成多目标图像，利用预定义的对象对应关系优化表示。

Conclusion: MOS方法显著提升了多目标图像的无监督表示性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注样本不足和边界细节捕捉不精确的问题。

Conclusion: C3S3在医学图像分割中显著提升了边界细节的精确度和整体性能。

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Conclusion: GFVC在工业应用中具有巨大潜力，但仍需解决当前挑战以推动未来发展。

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VideoLLM在自由文本生成任务中表现出严重的幻觉问题，而现有基准测试主要依赖多选题，无法全面评估其性能。

Method: 通过比较VideoLLM生成的视频字幕与人工标注的真实字幕，量化幻觉率（错误描述）和遗漏率（重要细节缺失）。

Result: ARGUS提供了双重指标，全面衡量视频字幕生成的质量。

Conclusion: ARGUS为VideoLLM的性能评估提供了更全面的标准，有助于改进模型在自由文本生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

Motivation: 现有协作感知研究主要针对车辆类别，缺乏对多类别对象的有效解决方案，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了全局空间注意力融合模块（GSAF）、视觉语义重识别模块（REID）和速度自适应的轨迹管理模块（VATM）。

Result: 在V2X-Real和OPV2V数据集上，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多类别道路用户提供了高效的协作检测与跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中的两大挑战：域差距和少量数据微调。

Method: 提出域特征导航器（DFN）解耦域信息，并设计SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot场景下，分别超越现有方法2.69%和4.68% MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Result: 在两个视觉数据集和八个主流视觉语言模型上验证了MrM的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MrM在多模态RAG系统中实现了高效的成员推理攻击，填补了视觉模态的研究空白。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Result: 数据集具有代表性，但现有指标无法完全捕捉语义退化，需要更精细的指标。

Conclusion: 论文为CFQA研究提供了基础资源，并呼吁开发更有效的评估指标。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Conclusion: DPFormer有效解决了持续学习中的关键问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Conclusion: GLOS通过gloss级条件和TAC模块显著提升了手语生成的词序和语义准确性。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Method: 提出Reg-GRPO（将GRPO目标重构为回归任务）和难度感知数据增强策略，动态增强训练样本。

Result: DeepVideo-R1在多个视频推理基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Reg-GRPO和难度感知数据增强策略有效解决了GRPO在视频大语言模型中的学习问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

### [240] [Ambiguity-Restrained Text-Video Representation Learning for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07471)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ARL的框架，用于处理部分相关视频检索中的文本-视频对模糊性问题，通过多正对比学习和双重三重边际损失提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRVR训练假设文本查询与视频为一对一关系，忽略了文本与视频内容之间的模糊性，导致模型性能受限。

Method: ARL通过检测模糊对（基于不确定性和相似性），并采用多正对比学习和双重三重边际损失进行分层学习，同时探索视频实例内的细粒度关系。

Result: 提出的方法在PRVR任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: ARL通过处理模糊性和细粒度关系，显著提升了PRVR的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Result: CoCoA-Mix在专用化和泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过混淆感知和置信感知机制，有效提升了模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: DriveAnyMesh是一种通过单目视频驱动网格的方法，解决了现有4D生成技术在渲染效率和跨类别泛化上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前4D生成技术在现代渲染引擎中效率低下或需要大量手动工作，且缺乏跨类别泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种4D扩散模型，通过去噪潜在集序列并解码为网格动画，利用基于变压器的变分自编码器捕获3D形状和运动信息。

Result: 实验表明，DriveAnyMesh能快速生成高质量动画，兼容现代渲染引擎。

Conclusion: 该方法在游戏和电影行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data
and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs. These outputs include
architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes
with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods which exploit
task-specific network designs, our model adheres to the standard multimodal LLM
architecture and is fine-tuned directly from open-source LLMs.
  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art
performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object
detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial
understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented
reality, embodied robotics, and more.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view
driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal
consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics
(FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including
segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MoQAE在效率和效果上均优于现有KV缓存量化方法。

Conclusion: MoQAE通过混合精度量化和优化路由机制，显著提升了长上下文推理的内存效率。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics

applications.

Motivation: 光学相干断层扫描（OCT）成本高且依赖专业操作，而2D眼底摄影更易获取。生成AI在医学图像合成中表现优异，但2D到3D转换面临挑战。

Method: 挑战赛提供了基准数据集和评估方法（图像和视频距离指标），吸引了342个团队参与，其中9个决赛团队采用了混合数据预处理、预训练和模型架构改进等方法。

Result: 挑战赛首次证明了从眼底图像生成3D OCT的可行性，为资源匮乏地区的眼科护理提供了潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: APTOS-2024挑战赛为生成模型在眼科医疗中的应用提供了基准，有望加速医学研究和临床实践。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私图像合成方法难以生成高分辨率且忠实于原始数据的图像，SPTI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPTI将图像转换为文本描述，利用差分隐私文本生成方法生成隐私保护文本，再通过文本到图像模型重建图像。

Result: 在LSUN Bedroom和MM CelebA HQ数据集上，SPTI的FID显著优于现有方法（如26.71 vs 40.36）。

Conclusion: SPTI为生成高分辨率差分隐私图像提供了一种资源高效且兼容专有模型的框架。

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Motivation: 现有H&E到IHC研究常忽略细胞核与细胞膜的跨通道相关性，限制了病理图像分析与诊断的准确性。

Method: CCPL将HER2免疫组化染色分解为Hematoxylin和DAB染色通道，利用Gigapath的Tile Encoder提取双通道特征并计算跨通道相关性，同时通过特征蒸馏损失和光学密度统计分析提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明CCPL在PSNR、SSIM、PCC和FID等指标上表现优异，生成的虚拟染色图像质量高，且得到病理学家的专业认可。

Conclusion: CCPL能有效保留病理特征，生成高质量虚拟染色图像，为多媒体医疗数据的自动化病理诊断提供支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across

cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,

OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Uncertainty-o框架，用于统一评估和量化多模态模型（LMMs）的不确定性，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型（LMMs）被认为比纯语言模型（LLMs）更鲁棒，但其不确定性的评估和量化仍存在挑战。论文旨在解决三个关键问题：统一评估、提示设计和量化方法。

Method: 提出Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的不确定性揭示方法、多模态提示扰动的实证探索，以及多模态语义不确定性的量化公式。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上的实验表明，Uncertainty-o能可靠估计不确定性，并提升下游任务（如幻觉检测和缓解）的性能。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为LMMs的不确定性评估和量化提供了有效工具，对下游任务有显著帮助。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

*Boyu Chen,Siran Chen,Kunchang Li,Qinglin Xu,Yu Qiao,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的超级编码网络（SEN），通过递归关联多模态编码器，提升视频理解任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型仅通过对比学习对齐不同模态的编码器，缺乏更深层次的多模态交互，而这对理解复杂视频场景至关重要。

Method: 将预训练的编码器视为“超级神经元”，设计递归关联（RA）块，逐步融合多模态信息，实现知识整合、分发和提示。

Result: SEN显著提升了四种代表性视频任务（跟踪、识别、聊天和编辑）的表现，例如像素级跟踪的Jaccard指数提高2.7%，文本对齐提升6.4%。

Conclusion: SEN通过递归多模态交互，有效提升了视频理解能力，为下游任务提供了强大支持。

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了一种利用扩散模型API生成合成图像以训练高性能替代模型的新型安全威胁，成功实现了对黑盒分类模型的提取和对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力带来了安全和隐私风险，如版权侵犯和信息泄露，本研究旨在揭示其潜在威胁。

Method: 通过扩散模型API生成高质量合成图像，训练替代模型，用于对黑盒分类模型进行提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅用0.01倍查询预算，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了扩散模型在安全领域的潜在威胁，需引起重视并采取防范措施。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定长度分块的RAG方法破坏了视频的上下文连续性，无法捕捉真实场景边界，而人类能够自然地将连续经验组织为连贯场景。

Method: SceneRAG利用大语言模型分割视频为叙事一致的场景，通过轻量级启发式和迭代校正优化边界，并融合多模态信息构建动态知识图谱。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG以72.5%的胜率显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过场景分割和多模态融合，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains
hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and
systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的图像编辑方法存在模糊性和操作繁琐的问题，难以高质量完成编辑任务。

Method: 将拖拽编辑重新定义为用户指定区域的变形、旋转和平移，提出Latent Region Optimization (LRO)框架，并通过Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI)实现优化。

Result: DragNeXt在NextBench上的实验表明，其性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DragNeXt通过区域级结构信息和渐进式指导，简化了拖拽编辑流程并提升了编辑质量。

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Motivation: 解决人类活动识别（HAR）中标记数据稀缺的问题，探索跨模态生成虚拟IMU数据的有效性。

Method: 构建大规模虚拟IMU数据集，比较视频和语言两种生成方法与传统数据增强技术，并在多个基准数据集上评估。

Result: 虚拟IMU数据显著优于单独使用真实或增强数据，尤其在数据有限时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提供了选择数据生成策略的实用建议，并总结了每种方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型计算密集，边缘设备难以部署，视觉输入中存在冗余信息导致效率低下。

Method: EP-VLM采用事件数据引导RGB输入的稀疏化处理，并设计位置保留的视觉编码策略。

Result: 相比Qwen2-VL-2B，EP-VLM节省50%计算量，精度仅损失2%。

Conclusion: 事件视觉先验可显著提升VLM效率，为边缘设备部署高效模型提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Conclusion: HuSc3D填补了现有数据集的不足，为3D重建模型在现实挑战下的评估提供了独特工具。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Result: 在120类花粉数据集上，mAP@.5达到0.9501，优于YOLOv12n和RT-DETR。

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为高精度、高效率的微小目标检测提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

Conclusion: FMaMIL在数字病理学中具有高效性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV-10K数据集上，ProSplat的PSNR平均提升1 dB。

Conclusion: ProSplat通过两阶段框架和优化技术，显著提升了宽基线条件下的渲染质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for

of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for

termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视不同退化类型的多样性，统一处理导致效果不佳。研究发现退化类型可分为空间无关和空间相关两类，需针对性解决。

Method: 引入动态滤波网络，包含全局动态滤波层（处理空间无关退化）和局部动态滤波层（处理空间相关退化），通过注意力机制和空间特定卷积操作实现。

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上，该方法优于现有盲超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: 动态滤波网络能有效区分并处理不同类型的图像退化，显著提升重建效果。

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Conclusion: FlowV2V在时间一致性和样本质量上优于现有方法，并通过消融实验验证了其内部功能的有效性。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Motivation: 解决SNN中二进制激活信息不足导致的精度下降问题。

Method: 采用实值激活和二进制权重，引入可训练因子调整权重幅度，并通过重参数化保持推理效率。

Result: 在多种网络架构和数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN在保持SNN高效性的同时显著提升了精度。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决大模型在自动驾驶系统中因计算量大而导致的响应速度慢的问题，同时保持高性能。

Method: 提出ETA系统，通过异步设计将当前帧的计算任务分散到之前的时间步，结合小模型实时提取特征和大模型的预测特征，通过动作掩码机制整合双特征。

Result: 在Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2基准测试中，ETA系统将驾驶分数提升8%，达到69.53，同时保持50ms的接近实时推理速度。

Conclusion: ETA系统成功实现了大模型在自动驾驶系统中的高效应用，平衡了性能和响应速度。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

Motivation: 随着3D目标检测在自动驾驶等领域的广泛应用，其高能耗问题日益突出。SNN因其低功耗特性成为潜在解决方案，但其离散信号会导致信息损失。

Method: 提出CSGC机制，结合跨尺度融合和门控滤波增强特征表示；设计轻量级残差块以降低计算量并保持性能。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，SpikeSMOKE性能显著提升（Easy +2.82，Moderate +3.2，Hard +3.17），同时能耗降低72.2%，性能仅下降4%。轻量版参数和计算量分别减少3倍和10倍。

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE为低功耗3D目标检测提供了有效方案，通过CSGC和轻量设计平衡了性能与能耗。

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

Motivation: 设计师更倾向于使用标准化资产库，而生成模型在此领域的应用尚未显著提升。

Method: AssetDropper通过提取选定对象的前视图，处理复杂场景（如透视变形和遮挡），并使用预训练的奖励模型进行闭环反馈优化。

Result: 实验表明，AssetDropper在资产提取任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AssetDropper为设计师提供了一个开放世界资产调色板，并通过奖励驱动优化显著提升了资产提取的精度。

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Motivation: 传统建筑文化研究依赖主观专家解读和历史文献，存在区域偏见和解释范围有限的问题。

Method: 构建ArchDiffBench数据集（1,765张高质量建筑图像），开发ArchiLense框架，结合计算机视觉和深度学习技术实现自动分类。

Result: ArchiLense在风格识别中表现优异，与专家标注一致性达92.4%，分类准确率为84.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为建筑文化比较研究提供了更客观、准确的视角，超越了传统分析的主观性。

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Conclusion: Flow-Anything为光流估计提供了更真实的数据来源，展示了从真实图像生成训练数据的潜力。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如视觉上下文学习或视觉指令）通常局限于特定模型（如InstructPix2Pix），可能导致偏见或编辑能力受限。

Method: 通过Delta插值提取A和A'的差异，结合B的提示生成B'；引入Token一致性损失和零初始化Token嵌入以提高训练准确性。

Result: 实验表明，Difference Inversion在定量和定性上均优于现有基线，能够以模型无关的方式生成更可行的B'。

Conclusion: Difference Inversion是一种有效的模型无关方法，能够生成高质量的B'，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 当前可见光和红外图像融合方法缺乏标准化评估和高质量数据集，限制了其在实际任务中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个包含1,369对图像的双光谱数据集，并提出了一种结合融合速度、通用指标和目标检测性能的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，针对下游任务优化的融合模型在目标检测中表现更优，尤其是在低光和遮挡场景下。

Conclusion: 论文通过数据集和评估框架的贡献，为未来图像融合研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过图像重建解释视觉特征的新方法，比较了SigLIP和SigLIP2模型，发现基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留了更多信息，并揭示了特征空间的操作如何影响重建图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉编码器在应用中表现出色，但其内部特征表示机制尚不明确，需要一种方法来解释其特征空间。

Method: 通过图像重建比较不同视觉编码器（如SigLIP和SigLIP2）的特征表示能力，并分析特征空间的操作对重建图像的影响。

Result: 基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留更多信息；特征空间的旋转操作控制颜色编码。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何视觉编码器，揭示了特征空间的内在结构，为理解视觉编码器提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

Motivation: 现有VideoQA方法依赖显式视觉证据，但在涉及符号意义或深层意图时表现不佳，因此需要解决隐式视觉证据的问题。

Method: 提出了IRM框架，包括Action-Intent Module（AIM）和Visual Enhancement Module（VEM），分别通过生成线索候选和关系推理以及增强视觉表示来处理隐式问题。

Result: IRM在I-VQA任务中表现优于GPT-4o、OpenAI-o3和VideoChat2，分别提升0.76%、1.37%和4.87%。

Conclusion: IRM在隐式视频问答任务中表现出色，并扩展到广告理解和交通预测等类似任务。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in

TL;DR: CasArbi是一种新型的自级联扩散框架，用于任意尺度图像超分辨率，通过逐步增强分辨率实现灵活上采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率缺乏灵活性，而现有单阶段上采样方法难以适应广泛的连续尺度分布。

Method: 采用自级联扩散框架，将大尺度分解为小尺度序列，结合坐标引导的残差扩散模型学习连续图像表示。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，感知和失真性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过渐进式上采样和扩散模型的结合，实现了高效且灵活的任意尺度超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2Restore提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的Mamba-CNN融合框架，用于高效且鲁棒的全能图像恢复，解决了现有方法在泛化性和局部-全局平衡上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像常受复合退化（如雨、雪、雾）影响，现有方法在动态变化的退化场景中泛化能力有限，且难以平衡局部细节与全局依赖建模。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP引导的MoE门控机制，结合任务条件提示和CLIP语义先验；2. 设计双流架构，融合CNN的局部表征与Mamba的长程建模；3. 引入边缘感知动态门控机制，自适应平衡全局与局部计算。

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准测试中，M2Restore在视觉质量和定量性能上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: M2Restore通过创新的架构设计，显著提升了图像恢复的泛化能力和细节保留效果。

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Conclusion: R3D2为自动驾驶验证提供了可扩展且真实的仿真解决方案，并公开数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

Motivation: 填补扩散模型在小噪声条件下行为的理解空白，探讨模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 使用CelebA子集和高斯混合基准，分析模型在低噪声下的表现。

Result: 模型在数据流形附近表现不同，训练集大小、数据几何和模型目标影响去噪轨迹和分数准确性。

Conclusion: 为理解扩散模型如何学习数据分布提供了新见解，对实际应用中的模型可靠性有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2Net是一个频率感知框架，通过分解超高清遥感图像为高频和低频成分进行专门处理，解决了传统方法在细节丢失和全局上下文碎片化之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高清遥感图像的语义分割在环境监测和城市规划中至关重要，但传统方法因下采样或分块处理导致细节丢失或上下文碎片化，多分支网络则存在计算效率低和梯度冲突问题。

Method: F2Net将图像分解为高频和低频成分，高频分支保留全分辨率细节，低频分支通过双子分支捕获短程和长程依赖关系，并通过混合频率融合模块整合。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和Inria Aerial基准测试中，F2Net分别达到80.22和83.39的mIoU，表现最优。

Conclusion: F2Net通过频率分解和融合模块，结合新颖的损失函数，实现了高效且稳定的超高清遥感图像语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明PolyVivid在身份保真度、视频真实性和主体对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PolyVivid在多主体视频定制中实现了灵活且身份一致的生成，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

TL;DR: SAM2Auto是一个完全自动化的视频数据集标注工具，无需人工干预或数据集特定训练，显著减少标注时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因标注数据集稀缺而发展受限的问题。

Method: 结合SMART-OD（自动掩码生成与开放世界目标检测）和FLASH（实时视频实例分割），通过统计方法减少检测错误并保持对象跟踪一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SAM2Auto的标注精度与人工相当，同时大幅提升效率。

Conclusion: SAM2Auto为自动化视频标注设定了新基准，有望加速视觉语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖局部特征，缺乏对更丰富语义先验的探索。本文旨在通过结合局部和全局特征提升无监督3D语义分割性能。

Method: LogoSP通过频域中的全局模式分组超点，生成高精度语义伪标签，用于训练分割网络。

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP大幅超越现有无监督方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了全局模式能有效表示无标签训练下的3D语义信息，为无监督3D语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在高速度乒乓球运动中存在延迟和运动模糊，事件相机提供了更高的时间分辨率，能够更频繁地更新状态并提高轨迹预测的准确性。

Method: 系统利用Meta Project Aria眼镜的传感器数据和事件流，结合注视点数据（foveated vision）处理关键区域事件，显著降低计算延迟。

Result: 系统在最坏情况下的总延迟为4.5毫秒，比基于帧的30 FPS系统快14.7倍，轨迹预测模型实现了3D轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用事件相机从第一人称视角预测乒乓球轨迹的方法，显著提升了实时性和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂物理运动或边界时表现不佳，且依赖对象先验（如掩码或类型）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和新收集的真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在未来帧外推和运动分割方面。

Conclusion: 物理编码能学习无标签的3D物理运动模式，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空状态空间模型（STSSM）的高效事件相机光流估计方法，显著提升了计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低延迟光流估计中具有潜力，但现有深度学习方法（如CNN、RNN、ViT）计算效率不足，而异步事件方法（如SNN、GNN）又缺乏足够的时空信息捕捉能力。

Method: 设计了STSSM模块和新型网络架构，利用状态空间模型高效捕捉事件数据的时空相关性。

Result: 在DSEC基准测试中，模型推理速度提升4.5倍，计算量减少8倍（相比TMA）或2倍（相比EV-FlowNet），同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: STSSM方法在事件相机光流估计中实现了高效与高性能的平衡，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

Conclusion: EgoM2P为自我中心4D理解提供通用解决方案，将开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Motivation: 视频生成模型可能继承训练数据中的偏见和有害内容，导致用户生成不良或非法内容，亟需解决方案。

Method: 通过多模态提示对生成拒绝向量，并采用低秩分解方法优化拒绝向量的鲁棒性，直接嵌入模型参数中。

Result: 能够有效消除多种有害内容（如裸露、暴力、版权等），同时保持视频生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或原始数据，直接嵌入拒绝向量，提高了对抗性绕过尝试的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态上下文学习（MM-ICL）中依赖浅层启发式方法，而非真正理解任务。通过分布偏移评估，发现性能随演示增加而下降，模型倾向于复制答案。提出新方法MM-ICL with Reasoning，但实验表明当前VLMs未能有效利用演示信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否真正具备多模态上下文学习能力，而非依赖浅层启发式方法。

Method: 提出MM-ICL with Reasoning方法，为每个演示生成答案及理由，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 性能对演示数量、检索方法等因素不敏感，表明当前VLMs未能有效利用演示信息。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态上下文学习中表现有限，需进一步改进以提升任务理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Motivation: 当前方法在图像分割任务中破坏了对象间的空间连续性，需要一种既能保留空间关系又能进行复杂推理的新方法。

Method: DTwinSeger将任务分为两阶段：首先生成保留空间关系的DT表示，然后利用LLM进行显式推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，证明了DT表示作为视觉与文本桥梁的有效性。

Conclusion: DTwinSeger展示了DT表示在多模态推理任务中的潜力，为复杂任务提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Motivation: 现有基准难以全面评估MLLMs从原子到组合层面的空间智能，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 定义了10种原子空间能力和8种组合能力，采用分层标注流程生成高质量QA对。

Result: 测试发现，即使最先进的MLLM在空间智能上仍远落后于人类，特别是计数能力不足限制了组合能力。

Conclusion: SpaCE-10填补了MLLMs空间智能评估的空白，并揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are

TL;DR: CyberV是一个基于控制论原理的框架，通过动态资源分配和自我修正提升视频MLLMs的性能，显著提高了模型在复杂视频理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理长或复杂视频时存在计算需求高、鲁棒性差和准确性不足的问题，尤其是参数较少的模型表现更差。

Method: 提出CyberV框架，包含MLLM推理系统、传感器和控制器，通过监控和反馈实现动态调整。

Result: 实验显示CyberV显著提升模型性能，例如Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3%，InternVL3-8B提升5.5%，甚至接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: CyberV通过动态适应机制有效提升了MLLMs的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于复杂视频理解任务。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Conclusion: 该框架公开了代码和数据集，促进T2I研究社区的可重复评测和跨模型比较。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional

latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a

demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效且准确的众包评估策略，用于评估神经元解释方法的可靠性，通过重要性采样和贝叶斯方法显著降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元解释方法的可靠性评估通常依赖众包，但存在噪音大、成本高的问题。

Method: 引入重要性采样选择最有价值的输入样本，并采用贝叶斯方法聚合评分，显著减少所需评分数量。

Result: 实现了约30倍的成本降低和约5倍的评分数量减少，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模比较神经元解释方法提供了高效且可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TACA的方法，通过动态调整跨模态注意力的温度和时间步依赖的权重，解决了MM-DiT模型中文本与图像对齐的问题，显著提升了生成内容与文本提示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MM-DiT模型（如FLUX）在文本驱动的视觉生成中存在文本与生成内容对齐不精确的问题，主要源于跨模态注意力不平衡和缺乏时间步感知的权重调整。

Method: 提出TACA方法，通过温度缩放和时间步依赖的调整动态平衡多模态交互，并结合LoRA微调，以最小的计算开销提升对齐效果。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，TACA显著提升了文本与图像的匹配度，包括物体外观、属性绑定和空间关系。该方法在FLUX和SD3.5等先进模型上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了平衡跨模态注意力对提升文本到图像扩散模型语义保真度的重要性，TACA为这一问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: PairEdit是一种无需文本指导的视觉编辑方法，通过少量图像对学习复杂编辑语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于示例的编辑方法依赖文本描述，某些编辑语义难以用文本精确表达。

Method: 提出目标噪声预测和内容保持噪声调度，优化LoRAs以分离语义变化与内容学习。

Result: PairEdit成功学习复杂语义，显著提升内容一致性。

Conclusion: PairEdit是一种高效的无文本视觉编辑方法，适用于复杂语义学习。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Pose提出了一种不确定性感知的6D物体姿态估计方法，适用于部分参考数据，显著提升了在不完整观测下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要完整3D模型或大量参考图像，而部分参考数据下的6D姿态估计仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于有限RGBD图像或单张2D图像生成部分3D模型，并引入不确定性区分已见和未见区域，指导在线物体补全。

Result: 在YCB-Video等数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在不完整观测下。

Conclusion: UA-Pose通过不确定性感知策略，有效解决了部分参考数据下的6D姿态估计问题。

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了MADFormer，一种结合自回归（AR）和扩散模型的混合方法，用于分析两者之间的权衡，并通过实验验证了其在高质量图像生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合方法缺乏系统性的指导，无法明确如何分配模型能力。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，使用AR层进行全局条件化，扩散层进行局部细化。

Result: 实验表明，块划分显著提升高分辨率图像性能，混合AR和扩散层在质量和效率上取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为未来混合生成模型提供了实用的设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Conclusion: 通过量化形状编码丰富了3D模态，验证了模型在复杂3D物体形状重建和识别任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating
and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in
language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on
real-world 3D object recognition tasks. Project webpage:

TL;DR: MTV是一个用于音频同步视频生成的框架，通过分离音频为语音、音效和音乐轨道，实现精细控制和语义对齐的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频与视觉世界紧密同步，是可控视频生成的理想控制信号，但现有方法在高质量视频生成和精确音视频同步方面表现不足。

Method: MTV框架将音频分为语音、音效和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉情绪，并引入DEMIX数据集支持多阶段训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本-视频一致性和音视频对齐等六个标准指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MTV通过音频分离和多阶段训练实现了高质量且精确同步的视频生成。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Motivation: 解决动态视图合成中的确定性反转问题，特别是在零终端信噪比（SNR）调度下的挑战。

Method: 引入K阶递归噪声表示和随机潜在调制技术，优化噪声初始化阶段的潜在空间对齐和遮挡区域合成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够高效实现高保真动态视图合成。

Conclusion: 通过结构化潜在空间操作，动态视图合成可在噪声初始化阶段有效完成。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Motivation: 现有视觉里程计方法依赖预定义或静态相机校准，限制了其泛化能力。ZeroVO旨在克服这一限制，提供无需微调或校准的通用解决方案。

Method: 设计了无校准的几何感知网络结构，结合语言先验增强特征提取，并采用半监督训练范式适应新场景。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和Argoverse 2等基准测试中性能提升30%以上，并在GTA合成数据集中表现优异。

Conclusion: ZeroVO扩展了视觉里程计的适用性，为实际大规模部署提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

Conclusion: Dreamland在可控性和生成质量上表现优异，有望推动AI代理训练的发展。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

TL;DR: VLMs在视觉任务中表现不佳，主要原因是未能有效整合视觉和语言信息，且受语言模型先验影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）在整合视觉和语言信息方面的能力，并诊断其失败模式。

Method: 通过一系列视觉中心基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系）比较VLMs与其视觉编码器的表现，并分析其瓶颈。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于视觉编码器，接近随机水平；瓶颈在于未能有效利用视觉信息且受语言先验影响。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉任务中的表现受限于语言模型的先验和视觉信息整合能力，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Motivation: 解决自回归视频扩散模型在推理时因依赖自身不完美输出而产生的曝光偏差问题。

Method: 在训练时通过自回归展开和KV缓存，基于自生成输出生成帧，并使用视频级损失监督。采用少步扩散模型和梯度截断策略平衡计算成本与性能。

Result: 实现了单GPU上的实时视频生成，延迟低于1秒，生成质量与更慢的非因果扩散模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: Self Forcing在高效性和生成质量上均表现出色，为实时视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Conclusion: 测试时注册令牌可替代训练时注册令牌，为未配备注册令牌的预训练模型提供无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableMTL利用扩散模型在零样本设置下进行多任务学习，通过合成数据集和统一潜在损失实现任务扩展，并通过任务注意力机制提升跨任务共享性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中需要大量标注的问题，探索零样本学习以降低标注成本。

Method: 采用扩散模型，结合任务编码、任务条件化和统一潜在损失，设计多流模型和任务注意力机制。

Result: 在8个基准测试的7个任务上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StableMTL通过合成数据和任务注意力机制，有效实现了零样本多任务学习，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DGT是一种基于4D高斯的Transformer模型，用于动态场景重建，通过单目视频训练，统一静态和动态组件，实现高效渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态场景重建中复杂时间变化环境和对象寿命差异的建模问题。

Method: 使用4D高斯作为归纳偏置，提出密度控制策略，处理长时空输入，滚动窗口预测一致的4D高斯。

Result: 在真实视频中显著优于其他高斯网络，跨域视频中与优化方法精度相当，重建时间从小时级降至秒级。

Conclusion: 4DGT通过纯前馈推理高效重建动态场景，适用于长视频序列。

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的金融推理基准，结合文本和视觉数据评估AI模型，并提出了基于错误反馈的学习框架以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型在金融推理中缺乏对复杂视觉数据的理解能力，需开发新方法以提升多模态推理效果。

Method: 提出包含3,200个专家级问题的基准，结合文本与视觉数据，并设计错误感知学习框架以优化推理。

Result: 实验表明多模态输入显著提升性能，错误反馈带来持续改进，但视觉理解和数学逻辑仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 研究展示了自反思推理在金融AI中的潜力，同时揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also
the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend
graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI
models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in
finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs
across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textual and
visual modalities to reflect authentic analytical challenges in finance. To
address limitations in current reasoning approaches, we propose an error-aware
learning framework that leverages historical model mistakes and feedback to
guide inference, without requiring fine-tuning. Our experiments across
state-of-the-art models show that multimodal inputs significantly enhance
performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and
measurable improvements. The results highlight persistent challenges in visual
understanding and mathematical logic, while also demonstrating the promise of
self-reflective reasoning in financial AI systems. Our code and data can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，用于表示不存在或可能永远不会存在的实体的信息，如虚构实体、蓝图、模拟和未来场景。批评了传统的“虚拟实例”或模态逻辑方法，并提出了通过实际类型的交集而非特定不存在的标记来建模这些案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理不存在实体时要么过度依赖形而上学假设，要么引入计算低效性，阻碍了实际应用。本文旨在提供一种实用且计算可行的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于基本形式本体论的结构化本体驱动方法，通过实际类型的交集建模非存在实体。

Result: 提出了一种实用且计算高效的框架，能够有效处理对假设或非存在实体的引用。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持本体论现实主义的同时，提供了处理非存在实体的实用方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities
that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional
entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches
that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a
proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of
actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing
a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to
provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to
hypothetical or non existent entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS)实现，限制了其可访问性和广泛应用。

Method: 开发了evolvingfuzzysystems库，实现了多种eFS模型，并提供了训练、可视化和性能评估工具。使用fetch_california_housing数据集评估模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明ePL模型在准确性和计算成本之间取得了平衡，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 通过公开这些模型，evolvingfuzzysystems旨在推动自适应和可解释机器学习的研究与应用。

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their
ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while
maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available
implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread
adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python
library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,
including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The
library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

TL;DR: 综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在提升道路安全和交通流动性中的应用，探讨了其潜力、挑战及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以应对复杂动态的交通环境，LLMs因其强大的语言理解和推理能力被视为一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 通过架构调整、训练策略、提示工程和多模态融合等方式定制LLMs，以适配交通领域的时空和物理数据。

Result: LLMs在交通流量预测、信号控制、事故分析和驾驶员行为评估等方面展现出潜力，但仍面临幻觉、数据隐私等技术挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs有望变革交通系统，但需负责任地创新以克服现有局限，实现更安全、智能的交通管理。

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 由于现有研究中术语使用不一致，且该领域较新，作者希望通过系统梳理现有文献，明确术语差异、探索智能代理与任务领域的多样性，并分析认知理论与框架的应用。

Method: 采用范围综述方法，收集并分析现有文献，重点关注术语、智能代理类型、任务领域及认知理论与框架。

Result: 预期结果包括术语的明确分类、智能代理与任务领域的多样性展示，以及认知理论与框架的系统总结。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解人-代理协作的动态性，并为未来研究提供理论指导，尤其是在复杂动态领域。

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning
and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this
collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

TL;DR: 论文提出MemoryOS，一种创新的内存操作系统，用于解决LLMs的固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足问题，提升长期记忆能力和个性化交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs面临固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足的挑战，导致长期记忆能力不足和个性化交互体验受限。

Method: 设计MemoryOS，包含分层存储架构和四个关键模块（存储、更新、检索、生成），采用三级存储单元（短、中、长期记忆）和动态更新策略。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，F1和BLEU-1分别平均提升49.11%和46.18%，显示长期对话中的上下文连贯性和个性化记忆保留。

Conclusion: MemoryOS通过分层内存集成和动态更新，显著提升了LLMs的长期记忆能力和个性化交互效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory
integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark
show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the
baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory
retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者对高级AI可能带来的灾难性风险表示担忧，认为强大的AI会追求权力作为工具性目标，但近期有人对此表示怀疑。本文旨在澄清这一争议。

Method: 采用抽象的决策理论框架，形式化工具性收敛和权力追求的概念。

Result: 权力作为工具性收敛目标的说法有一定道理，但在缺乏AI最终目标信息时，预测效用可能有限。

Conclusion: 工具性收敛现象在AI可能获得绝对或接近绝对权力时更具预测性。

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序知识图谱嵌入模型在推理时依赖训练中见过的元素，限制了其在新领域和真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 使用正弦位置编码捕捉细粒度时序模式，并通过消息传递生成适应性实体和关系表示，模型设计对时序粒度和时间跨度无关。

Result: POSTRA在未见过的时序知识图谱上表现出强大的零样本性能，能够泛化到新实体、关系和时间戳。

Conclusion: POSTRA作为预训练、可扩展和可迁移的模型，为时序知识图谱的基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅保留搜索树中的最优轨迹，忽略了非最优分支中的有价值信息，导致数据浪费。

Method: SIGMA通过语义链接和两阶段优化（批评模型和修订模型）重新整合非最优分支，优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，SIGMA调优的7B模型仅用30K样本达到54.92%准确率，优于使用590K样本的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA不仅显著减少数据需求，还大幅提升推理能力，证明了非最优分支的价值。

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型预训练模型在自动游戏设计中的应用多依赖人工监督，缺乏长期自主生成和测试的整合。

Result: 系统成功展示了LLM在生成新颖游戏内容中的自动化潜力。

Conclusion: ScriptDoctor为LLM在开放游戏设计流程中的应用提供了具体范例。

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多智能体AI系统在临床中表现优于单智能体系统，但组件优化（Best of Breed）虽在过程指标上表现优异（85.5%信息准确率），却在诊断准确率上显著落后（67.7% vs. 77.4%），需关注信息流与系统整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨组件优化与系统整体性能的关系，以优化临床AI系统的部署。

Method: 使用2,400例真实患者数据（MIMIC-CDM），对比单智能体与多智能体系统在诊断、过程指标和成本效率上的表现。

Result: 多智能体系统整体表现更优，但组件优化系统在诊断准确率上显著落后。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的成功整合需关注系统整体验证，而非仅依赖组件指标。

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in
the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI
simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely
and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open
new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of
physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability
to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In
this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI
simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends
and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components.
Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide
architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research
opportunities for prospective researchers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GELD的新型神经网络TSP求解器，通过全局评估和局部选择框架，结合轻量级编码器和重量级解码器，显著提升了求解质量和推理速度，并能处理超大规模TSP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络TSP求解器难以同时高效解决小规模和大规模TSP问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: GELD采用轻量级全局视图编码器（GE）和重量级局部视图解码器（LD）结合的低复杂度注意力机制，并提出两阶段训练策略以增强泛化能力。

Result: GELD在合成和真实数据集上优于七种先进模型，并能处理多达744,710个节点的TSP问题。

Conclusion: GELD不仅提升了现有神经求解器的解质量，还首次实现了无需分治策略的超大规模TSP求解。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

### [342] [Contextual Experience Replay for Self-Improvement of Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06698)
*Yitao Liu,Chenglei Si,Karthik Narasimhan,Shunyu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Contextual Experience Replay (CER)的无训练框架，帮助大型语言模型（LLM）代理在复杂任务中通过积累和利用过去经验实现自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在复杂任务（如网页导航）中表现不佳，且无法在推理时持续学习过去经验。

Method: CER通过动态内存缓冲区积累和合成过去经验（包括环境动态和决策模式），使代理能在新任务中检索相关知识。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena基准测试中，CER分别达到31.9%和36.7%的成功率，相对GPT-4o基线提升51.0%。

Conclusion: CER证明了其高效性和有效性，能够显著提升LLM代理在复杂环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

Motivation: 旨在通过SysML模型与AI规划的结合，提升工程设计的自动化水平。

Method: 定义了可重用的PDDL概念模板，并通过OCL约束确保语法一致性，案例研究展示了其在飞机制造中的应用。

Result: 成功生成了PDDL格式的域和问题描述，并通过PDDL求解器优化执行计划。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统建模与AI规划提供了可重用的桥梁，支持自动化生成规划描述。

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WorldLLM框架通过结合贝叶斯推断和强化学习，提升LLM在结构化领域中的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在结构化领域（如模拟）中预测不精确，因其无法将广泛知识应用于具体环境。

Method: 结合贝叶斯推断和强化学习，通过自然语言假设迭代优化预测。

Result: 在文本游戏环境中显著提升预测准确性，并生成可解释的环境动态理论。

Conclusion: WorldLLM有效解决了LLMs在结构化领域中的局限性，同时提供可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VisioMath是一个评估多模态数学推理能力的基准数据集，专注于图像选项的数学问题，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在图像选项的数学推理能力上表现不足，缺乏专门的评估工具。

Method: 提出VisioMath数据集，包含8,070张图像和1,800道多选题，答案选项均为图像，挑战现有LMMs。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进的GPT-4o模型，准确率仅为45.9%，表明模型在视觉相似选项上的推理能力有限。

Conclusion: VisioMath为未来多模态推理研究提供了严格的测试基准，推动技术进步。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

*Andrew Cropper,Filipe Gouveia,David M. Cerna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过背景知识缩小假设空间的ILP方法，显著减少学习时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程（ILP）中，假设空间通常很大，搜索效率低。通过预缩小假设空间，可以提高学习效率。

Method: 利用背景知识排除不可能出现在最优假设中的规则，并用答案集编程实现。

Result: 实验表明，预处理仅需10秒，学习时间可从10小时缩短至2秒，且预测精度不变。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升ILP系统的学习效率，适用于视觉推理和游戏等领域。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理咨询需求增长与专业人员短缺之间的矛盾促使研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）辅助心理咨询，但现有模型缺乏对情感的深入理解和个性化治疗能力。

Method: 通过细粒度情感分类和多代理框架构建AI PsyRoom，包括对话重建的PsyRoom A和生成个性化治疗方案的PsyRoom B。

Result: AI PsyRoom在问题导向、表达、同理心和交互沟通质量上分别提升18%、23%、24%和16%，并生成了高质量数据集EmoPsy。

Conclusion: AI PsyRoom为AI辅助心理咨询研究提供了基础，其数据集和模型已公开。

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for
mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large
language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling,
especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a
deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized
treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings,
we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance
psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced
conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a
multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue
reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which
contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.
We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23%
in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality.
The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for
advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN的训练因其独特的特性（如时间动态性、脉冲事件的不可微分性和稀疏事件驱动激活）而具有挑战性。研究旨在探索不同学习算法对分类准确性的影响。

Method: 提出了一种结合SNN和LZC的生物启发分类器，比较了经典反向传播算法与生物启发算法（如tempotron和Spikprop）的性能。

Result: 经典反向传播算法分类准确率高但计算成本极高，而生物启发算法在保持竞争力的同时提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 选择最适合的学习算法需权衡分类准确性和计算成本，并考虑应用场景的限制。

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

TL;DR: CA-MIQ是一种轻量级双批评家强化学习框架，通过动态调整探索策略适应任务优先级变化，在SAR任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的SAR任务需要系统在动态优先级下持续收集关键信息，现有方法难以灵活适应优先级变化。

Method: CA-MIQ结合外在和内在批评家，通过状态新颖性、信息位置感知和实时优先级对齐调整探索策略，内置优先级变化检测器。

Result: 在模拟SAR任务中，CA-MIQ在单次和多优先级变化场景下分别实现4倍和3倍性能提升，100%恢复率。

Conclusion: CA-MIQ适用于离散环境中信息价值分布分段平稳的任务，具有高效适应性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions
must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting
to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware
Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何通过概率度量理解文本，并探索其算法实现。

Result: Xent Games空间丰富，可作为LLMs能力评估的基准。

Conclusion: 通过进化动力学探索Xent Games空间，解决能力评估的无界范围问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理复杂任务时因认知负载过高表现受限，类似人类认知负载理论（CLT）。

Method: 基于CLT设计多智能体框架CoThinker，通过智能体分工和结构化通信管理负载。

Result: 实验验证CoThinker在复杂任务中优于基线，提升解决方案质量和效率。

Conclusion: CoThinker为突破LLM性能瓶颈提供了理论支持，展示了集体认知的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

Motivation: 由于机器学习模型在安全关键系统中的广泛应用，其推理失败（由数据分布偏移引起）带来了新的安全挑战，传统安全评估方法不适用于ML组件。

Method: 提出了一种概率安全保证框架，将SafeML与贝叶斯网络结合，动态检测数据分布偏移并建模ML失败，进行因果安全分析。

Result: 在模拟的自动驾驶车队系统中验证了该框架的有效性，展示了显式建模ML失败在安全评估中的潜在广泛益处。

Conclusion: 该框架为ML组件的动态安全评估和系统适应提供了一种新方法，特别适用于安全关键系统。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

Conclusion: KDR框架和KCII模型显著提升了知识分析任务的效率和深度，优于现有主流框架。

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中表现不稳定，尤其是小规模模型。作者认为这是由于图像嵌入中的冗余信息干扰了任务表现。

Method: 提出了一种元学习方法，通过任务相关的软提示和注意力映射模块（可集成到LLaVA v1.5架构中），在少量梯度步骤下实现任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上的评估显示，该方法在视觉问答任务中优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，即使在图像扰动下也表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LMMs在少样本任务中的适应性和推理能力，为低数据场景下的任务学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

Motivation: 现有自校正方法依赖额外提示和系统设计，无法实现实时自校正，SPOC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPOC通过多智能体视角（提案者和验证者角色）和合成数据微调，结合在线强化学习提升准确性。

Result: 实验显示SPOC显著提升模型性能，如Llama-3.1-8B在MATH500上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: SPOC通过实时自校正和多智能体协作，有效提升数学推理任务的性能。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,
and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic
metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent
autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses
external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes
memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and
adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够在满足约束的同时，实现任务效用的局部最大化。

Conclusion: 通过将德性逻辑约束与效用最大化结合，本文为强化学习中的约束优化问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过神经行为学工具分析DRL代理，可以揭示其隐藏的学习动态，为未来复杂代理的研究提供框架。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal
reasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained
by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline
processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,
the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best
baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架通过显式建模推理路径，有效解决了多跳事实验证中的复杂性问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Result: BRIGHT-Plus显著提升了检索准确性和多跳推理性能。

Conclusion: MARCUS和BRIGHT-Plus为未来稳健、以推理为中心的检索研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both
structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and
influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Conclusion: 定制化MyGPT代理在小规模数据下仍能提供实用的编码支持。

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

Conclusion: 动态任务扰动为评估模型泛化提供了更深入的视角，优于静态基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper

*Zihan Deng,Changyu Du,Stavros Nousias,André Borrmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIMgent是一个基于多模态大语言模型的代理框架，用于自动化建筑信息建模（BIM）中的3D建筑建模任务，通过GUI操作实现自主建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机代理主要关注通用桌面自动化任务，而在高度专业化的AEC领域（如BIM软件中的复杂交互和开放式设计任务）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: BIMgent利用多模态LLM，支持多模态输入（如概念设计）、规划软件特定工作流，并高效执行GUI操作。

Result: BIMgent在真实建模任务中实现了32%的成功率，而基线模型完全失败（0%）。设计质量合理，显著减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: BIMgent展示了在真实建筑建模场景中实际部署的潜力，能有效保留设计意图并提升效率。

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop
automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly
specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information
Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by
current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable
autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

*Yangqing Zheng,Shunqi Mao,Dingxin Zhang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间转换机制（TCM）和快速反射异步反思代理（RRARA），以解决动态高风险场景中决策延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态高风险场景（如火灾、洪水等）中，决策延迟是一个关键但研究不足的问题。

Method: 提出TCM将推理延迟转换为等效模拟帧，并设计RRARA结合轻量级LLM反馈模块和基于规则的代理。

Result: 实验表明，RRARA在延迟敏感场景中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TCM和RRARA为动态高风险场景中的延迟问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models
(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于子目标的学习方法，用于提升策略树搜索算法的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略树搜索算法在训练时需要完整的解轨迹，而解决困难问题时样本效率低，浪费大量搜索样本。

Method: 通过从搜索树（包括失败尝试的树）中学习子目标和基于子目标的策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了在线学习策略和启发式函数的样本效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了策略树搜索算法的训练效率。

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

*Xin-Cheng Wen,Yijun Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Yang Xiao,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ReVD框架，通过合成推理数据和优化漏洞偏好，提升LLM在漏洞检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在漏洞检测中表现有限，主要因缺乏推理数据和语义学习不足。

Method: 构建漏洞和修复代码的前后推理过程，设计三元组监督微调和课程在线偏好优化。

Result: 在PrimeVul和SVEN数据集上，ReVD性能提升12.24%-22.77%。

Conclusion: ReVD为基于LLM的漏洞检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和深度强化学习（DRL）的智能故障自愈机制（IFSHM），用于提升云AI系统的故障恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云AI系统的规模和复杂性增加，故障检测和自适应恢复成为确保服务可靠性和连续性的核心挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段混合架构：LLM驱动的故障语义解释模块提取多源日志的深层语义；DRL恢复策略优化器学习故障类型与响应行为的动态匹配。

Result: 实验表明，IFSHM框架在未知故障场景下将系统恢复时间缩短了37%。

Conclusion: IFSHM通过LLM和DRL的结合，显著提升了故障恢复的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉数学问题解决中的表现尚不完善，研究评估了多个模型在多种语言和难度下的表现，发现模型在不同任务和语言中表现不一，且对视觉信息的利用不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在视觉数学问题解决中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过多语言Kangaroo风格基准测试评估多个MLLMs（如GPT 4o、Pixtral等）在几何、代数、逻辑等任务中的表现。

Result: 模型在视觉任务中表现中等，Gemini 2.0 Flash表现最佳，但均未达到人类水平；模型对视觉信息的利用不足，且在不同语言和难度下表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MLLMs在视觉数学问题解决中仍有提升空间，需进一步优化模型对视觉信息的利用和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language
capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains
underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异构图神经网络攻击方法需复杂参数调整，无法快速适应新场景，而基础模型的出现为通用攻击提供了可能。

Method: 设计关系感知的基础攻击模型HeTa，通过基础替代模型对齐异构性，识别共享攻击单元，实现序列化关系攻击。

Result: 实验表明HeTa具有强大的攻击性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HeTa为异构图神经网络提供了一种通用且高效的攻击方法。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 现有法律判决预测方法在处理复杂法律推理时存在逻辑错误，影响了司法决策支持和效率提升。

Method: LegalReasoner通过识别争议点分解复杂案件，逐步推理并验证每一步逻辑，发现错误时采用专家设计的策略修正。

Result: 实验结果表明，LegalReasoner将LLAMA-3.1-70B模型与法院判决的一致性从72.37提升至80.27。

Conclusion: LegalReasoner通过逐步验证和修正推理过程，显著提升了法律判决预测的可靠性，并发布了LegalHK数据集支持研究。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

Motivation: 传统方法在处理需要多跳推理的复杂主张时表现不佳，因静态分解和浅层语义检索导致错误累积和噪声污染。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，AFEV实现了最先进的性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: AFEV显著提升了复杂主张的事实验证能力，为对抗错误信息提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

Motivation: 当前跨游戏最小化（XPM）方法在生成多样化的协作伙伴代理时计算成本高且样本效率低。

Method: 通过学习的动态模型生成模拟轨迹，避免多次采样，提出XPM-WM框架。

Result: XPM-WM能高效生成多样化伙伴代理，性能与现有方法相当，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: XPM-WM显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性，适用于更多伙伴代理的生成。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在LLM推理中表现出色，但其无法超越基础模型的限制，无法学习新知识。因此，需要一种方法结合RL和SFT的优势。

Method: 提出ReLIFT方法，交替使用RL和SFT训练模型，在遇到困难问题时收集高质量解决方案进行微调。

Result: ReLIFT在五个竞赛级基准和一个分布外基准上平均提升5.2分，且仅需13%的详细演示数据。

Conclusion: ReLIFT有效克服了RL的局限性，展示了结合RL和SFT的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

TL;DR: HARIS模型通过分层代理（推理和搜索）实现多跳声明验证，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳声明验证需要动态检索证据和推理的协同，现有方法难以有效结合两者。

Method: 提出HARIS模型，包含高层推理代理和低层搜索代理，通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在EX-FEVER和HOVER基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: HARIS通过分层代理设计显著提升了多跳声明验证的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了训练稳定性和最终性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 动态CL框架和CGRPA方法有效解决了MARL中的适应性和稳定性问题，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动光学化学结构识别技术更好地满足实际需求，促进化学信息学和AI科学的发展。

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW和SAFEFLOWBENCH为构建可靠、安全的代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了自主系统的前沿发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Conclusion: PROTEUS不仅能加速多组学分析，还为通用自主系统在专业科学领域的应用提供了路径，实现开放式假设生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended
data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It
formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through
exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and
heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability
and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents
a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific
domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的工具（如OpenAI Codex和Cursor）在软件工程任务中缺乏高质量训练数据和有效测试用例，限制了代理的效能。

Method: 开发了合成测试用例的管道，并扩展代理轨迹以构建训练数据，最终训练出SWE-Dev代理。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev展示了开源LLM在软件工程任务中的潜力，所有资源已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational
problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as
software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex
and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development
process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the
lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this
issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we
develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation.
Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for
building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the
SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents.
Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models
reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source

TL;DR: MCPWorld是一个自动化的计算机使用代理（CUA）测试平台，支持API、GUI及混合代理，通过白盒应用和动态代码检测提供稳健的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CUA基准主要针对GUI代理，易受UI变化影响且忽略API功能交互，MCPWorld旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用白盒应用（可修改/重新编译）和动态代码检测技术，MCPWorld支持API、GUI及混合代理的自动评估。

Result: MCPWorld包含201个用户任务，初步实验显示任务完成准确率达75.12%。

Conclusion: MCPWorld有望推动下一代CUA的标准化评测，支持丰富外部工具的利用。

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available
at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of
fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in
the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the
earliest phases of model development.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）经过安全对齐，但仍存在漏洞，外部防护模型依赖人工标注数据且难以应对分布外威胁。

Method: RSafe采用两阶段方法：1）引导推理，通过政策引导逐步分析输入内容的安全风险；2）强化对齐，利用基于规则的强化学习优化推理路径。

Result: RSafe能够内化安全原则，在未见或对抗性安全违规场景中提供泛化的保护能力。

Conclusion: RSafe通过用户指定的安全政策，提供定制化的安全保障，解决了现有防护模型的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

Motivation: 研究语义时空图模型的形式化特性，以支持可预测的定向知识表示和过程建模，同时解决图中吸收状态导致的信息泄漏问题。

Method: 定义有限的γ(3,4)表示，形成闭操作集，并通过语义时空假设和承诺理论分析吸收状态与边界信息的关系。

Result: 模型能够预测图中的路径，但吸收状态会导致信息泄漏，需要通过手动注入修复信息来解决。

Conclusion: 语义时空图模型为知识表示和过程建模提供了可扩展的框架，但需注意吸收状态带来的信息泄漏问题。

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

Conclusion: LLM可增强传统优化方法，提供更灵活、可解释且鲁棒的多目标优化方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法无法高效利用多种可复用的推理策略，而人类推理的灵活性和适应性是当前大型语言模型难以模拟的。

Method: Guideline Forest 从已验证的示例中提取可复用的指南，生成多样化的变体，并行执行并通过自校正逐步聚合。

Result: 在 GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP 和 HumanEval 四个基准测试中，Guideline Forest 表现优于 CoT、ReAct、ToT、FoT 和 AFlow 等基线方法。

Conclusion: Guideline Forest 通过多路径推理和逐步聚合展现了强大的适应性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large
language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection.
Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we
propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward
pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: ReMUD数据集和模型解决了特定领域MLLMs数据短缺问题，相关资源将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and

Result: 通过巴西联邦宪法的案例研究，验证了模型能精确重构法律文本在特定时间点的状态。

Conclusion: 该模型为法律信息系统和AI工具提供了可靠基础，克服了现有生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备解决传统AI中Frame Problem和Symbol Grounding Problem的能力，这两大问题曾被视作无解。

Method: 设计两个基准任务，零样本条件下测试13种LLMs（开源与封闭模型），评估输出质量（如上下文推理、语义连贯性等）。

Result: 开源模型表现因规模、量化和指令调整而异，部分封闭模型表现稳定且高分。

Conclusion: 部分现代LLMs可能具备解决长期理论挑战的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，现有知识与现实脱节限制了自主决策效果，需整合人类实时观察的上下文知识。

Method: LUCIFER框架采用分层决策架构，结合强化学习和LLM，LLM作为上下文提取器和探索引导者。

Result: LUCIFER在探索效率和决策质量上优于传统方法，验证了上下文驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: LUCIFER展示了整合人类上下文知识对自主系统成功的重要性。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集稀缺、合成或过于形式化，阻碍了不等式证明领域的进展。论文旨在通过新的任务设计和数据集推动该领域发展。

Method: 提出非正式但可验证的任务设计，分为边界估计和关系预测；发布IneqMath数据集，包含逐步解答和定理注释；开发LLM-as-judge评估框架。

Result: 评估显示，顶级LLM在逐步审查下准确率低于10%，与仅考虑最终答案的准确率相比下降高达65.5%，表明LLM在严格证明中的不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在不等式证明中的局限性，并提出了定理引导推理和自我优化等未来研究方向。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

*Christopher Subia-Waud*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gradients是一个去中心化的AutoML平台，通过竞争性市场机制优化超参数配置，显著优于传统集中式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML平台依赖单一优化策略，仅探索部分可行超参数配置，限制了性能提升。

Method: 将超参数优化转化为竞争性市场，独立矿工通过经济激励探索最优配置。

Result: 在180个实验中，Gradients胜率82.8%，平均性能提升11.8%至42.1%，复杂任务提升30-40%。

Conclusion: 经济驱动的竞争性方法能系统发现集中式AutoML遗漏的优越配置。

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的双奖励机制，通过理解与生成的逆对偶任务提升多模态模型的性能，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在图像-文本对齐上表现不佳，且依赖外部监督。本文旨在通过自监督方法解决这一问题。

Method: 基于理解与生成是逆对偶任务的观察，设计了自监督双奖励机制，通过反转输入-输出对计算双似然作为自我奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在视觉理解和生成任务中的性能，尤其在文本到图像任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效提升了LMMs的性能，无需外部监督，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了$	au^2$-bench，一个用于测试对话AI在双控制环境中的性能的基准，填补了现有单控制环境模拟的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话AI基准仅模拟单控制环境，而现实场景（如技术支持）需要用户主动参与。$	au^2$-bench旨在解决这一差距。

Method: 1) 提出Telecom双控制域，建模为Dec-POMDP；2) 设计任务生成器；3) 开发可靠用户模拟器；4) 通过多维度分析评估性能。

Result: 实验显示，从单控制到双控制时，AI性能显著下降，突显了引导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: $	au^2$-bench为需要高效推理和引导用户的AI提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Conclusion: GUI-Reflection为更智能的GUI自动化铺平道路，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种辅助一致性损失，解决稳定扩散微调中的欠拟合和过拟合问题，提升生成图像的多样性和主题一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法在主题驱动图像合成中存在欠拟合（无法可靠捕捉主题身份）和过拟合（记忆主题图像并减少背景多样性）的问题。

Method: 提出两种辅助一致性损失：先验一致性正则化损失（保持非主题图像的扩散噪声预测与预训练模型一致）和主题一致性正则化损失（增强模型对调制噪声的鲁棒性）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth，同时保持主题一致性。

Conclusion: 通过引入一致性损失，解决了微调中的关键问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Motivation: 从视频中忠实重建纹理形状和物理属性具有挑战性，现有方法依赖复杂优化流程，效率低且通用性差。

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在训练视角不足时，对未见过或被遮挡部分的渲染质量较低。环境中常见重复元素，可用来提升这些部分的渲染效果。

Method: 提出一种方法，在3DGS重建中分割每个重复实例，将其对齐并共享信息，同时考虑实例间的外观差异。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中验证，新视角合成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用重复元素能有效改善渲染质量，尤其在视角覆盖不足或遮挡情况下。

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: 提出的协同设计显著提升了3DGS在资源受限设备上的性能与能效，计划开源以推动领域发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

TL;DR: HOI-PAGE是一种从文本提示中零样本合成4D人-物交互（HOI）的新方法，通过部分级功能推理实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局的全身-物体运动，但生成真实多样的HOI需要更细粒度的理解，即人体部分如何与物体部分交互。

Method: 引入部分功能图（PAGs），从大语言模型提取细粒度部分信息，指导三阶段合成：分解3D物体、生成参考视频并提取运动约束、优化4D HOI序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能灵活生成复杂多物体或多人的交互序列，显著提升零样本4D HOI生成的逼真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE通过部分级功能推理，实现了更真实和多样化的4D HOI合成。

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Result: 在几何精度和渲染质量上显著优于现有方法，实时性高（单GPU 0.015s/推理）。

Conclusion: 为分辨率无关的3D场景增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Motivation: 现有3D数据压缩方法在压缩比和视觉质量之间存在权衡，Squeeze3D旨在通过预训练模型解决这一问题。

Method: 通过可训练的映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据压缩为紧凑潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D无需特定对象训练，支持多种3D格式，压缩和解压缩延迟低，是一种高效灵活的3D数据压缩框架。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

TL;DR: KRAMABENCH是一个包含104个真实世界数据科学管道的基准测试，用于评估AI系统在数据处理、发现、清理和编排方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统是否能够成功设计和执行复杂的数据科学管道，尤其是在需要广泛数据处理和领域知识的情况下。

Method: 使用KRAMABENCH基准测试，评估5个通用模型和3个代码生成模型在数据发现、清理、处理和编排任务中的表现。

Result: 现有模型在明确的数据科学代码生成任务中表现良好，但在需要复杂数据处理和领域知识的真实世界管道中表现不足。

Conclusion: KRAMABENCH是开发自主数据科学代理的关键步骤，现有模型仍需改进以应对真实世界挑战。

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are
available at https://github.com/mitdbg/KramaBench.

### [414] [CellCLIP -- Learning Perturbation Effects in Cell Painting via Text-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06290)
*Mingyu Lu,Ethan Weinberger,Chanwoo Kim,Su-In Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellCLIP是一个跨模态对比学习框架，用于处理高内涵筛选数据，通过预训练图像编码器和自然语言编码器，显著提升了性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用高内涵筛选技术（如Cell Painting）研究细胞形态对扰动的响应，但现有方法难以处理图像语义差异和扰动类型的多样性。

Method: 结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，构建统一的潜在空间。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和下游生物任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为高内涵筛选数据提供了一种高效且性能优越的跨模态学习方法。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

### [415] [Improvement of Optimization using Learning Based Models in Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06291)
*Xiaoke Wang,Batuhan Altundas,Zhaoxin Li,Aaron Zhao,Matthew Gombolay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习和图神经网络的框架，用于为混合整数线性规划（MILP）求解器提供高质量的初始解，以减少计算时间和方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合整数线性规划（MILP）在关键行业中有广泛应用，但计算时间长限制了其在大规模实时场景中的普及。

Method: 结合行为克隆（BC）和强化学习（RL）训练图神经网络（GNN），为多智能体任务分配和调度问题中的MILP求解器提供初始解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持解质量和可行性的同时，显著减少了优化时间和方差。

Conclusion: 该学习框架为MILP求解提供了高效的初始解，适用于实时和大规模场景。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving
planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as
construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time
scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that
leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), producing high-quality initial solutions for
warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling
Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization
time and variance compared to traditional techniques while maintaining solution
quality and feasibility.

### [416] [Mutual-Taught for Co-adapting Policy and Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06292)
*Tianyuan Shi,Canbin Huang,Fanqi Wan,Longguang Zhong,Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Xiaojun Quan,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Mutual-Taught方法，通过自我训练迭代优化策略模型（PM）和奖励模型（RM），解决分布偏移问题，无需额外人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLMs）偏好优化中，新生成样本与奖励模型训练数据间的分布偏移会降低RM效果，进而影响PM性能。

Method: 采用类似期望最大化（EM）算法的方法：E步用当前RM反馈更新PM；M步用PM输出更新RM，使RM适应策略分布变化。

Result: 实验显示方法持续提升模型性能，8B策略模型在AlpacaEval-2上胜率54.1%，8B奖励模型性能媲美GPT-4o-2024-08-06。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught通过迭代优化PM和RM，有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行信用评级对经济稳定和决策至关重要，但隐私问题导致完整的银行间连接图难以获取，限制了图神经网络的应用。

Method: 利用持久同源性构建银行关系网络，并与传统借贷网络结合形成异构图，通过HTGNN进行评级预测。

Result: 在真实全球数据集上的实验验证了HTGNN的有效性。

Conclusion: HTGNN为投资者和监管机构提供了改进风险缓解和市场干预的工具。

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

TL;DR: GLProtein是一个结合全局结构相似性和局部氨基酸细节的蛋白质预训练框架，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管蛋白质序列分析已取得进展，但整合蛋白质结构信息仍有潜力，尤其是从局部氨基酸到全局结构相似性的多层次信息。

Method: GLProtein创新性地结合了蛋白质掩码建模、三重结构相似性评分、3D距离编码和基于子结构的氨基酸分子编码。

Result: 实验表明，GLProtein在蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测、接触预测等任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLProtein通过整合多层次结构信息，为蛋白质功能预测提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

### [419] [dLLM-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with Adaptive Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06295)
*Zhiyuan Liu,Yicun Yang,Yaojie Zhang,Junjie Chen,Chang Zou,Qingyuan Wei,Shaobo Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为dLLM-Cache的缓存框架，显著降低了基于扩散的大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理延迟，接近自回归模型（ARMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs因双向注意力机制导致推理延迟高，传统加速技术不适用，需解决这一问题。

Method: 基于静态提示和部分动态响应的观察，设计了结合长间隔提示缓存和特征相似性引导的部分响应更新的训练免费缓存框架。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B上实验，dLLM-Cache实现了最高9.1倍的加速，且不牺牲输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache有效解决了dLLMs的高延迟问题，使其性能接近ARMs。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN框架结合动态图卷积神经网络（DGCNN）与Jacobi多项式KAN，用于三维点云分类，性能优于传统线性层DGCNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过集成KAN与DGCNN，探索多项式扩展在点云分类中的潜力，避免深度网络结构，提升效率和性能。

Method: 用可调单变量多项式扩展替换MLP层，在简化DGCNN架构中实现逐层比较，采用Jacobi多项式。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，Jacobi多项式KAN层在准确性和收敛速度上优于传统DGCNN，且参数高效。

Conclusion: 高多项式阶数未必提升性能，需进一步研究多项式基、阶数与图学习机制的相互作用。

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过离散事件随机模拟和强化学习优化医院超声心动图检查的调度策略，提升资源利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临非确定性因素（如患者爽约、到达时间、检查时长差异等）和资源不对称约束的挑战。

Method: 基于斯坦福大学医院一周数据预处理，构建SimPy离散事件随机模拟模型，结合Gymnasium库，比较动态分配与预留策略，并应用强化学习优化策略。

Result: 动态分配策略表现更优，适应性强；强化学习策略进一步提升了资源管理效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的动态资源管理策略可显著提升医院超声心动图检查的调度效率。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

*Daniel Halpern,Evi Micha,Ariel D. Procaccia,Itai Shapira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过多奖励函数分布来反映多样化人类偏好的方法，解决了传统对齐方法忽视少数观点的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好因用户、背景和文化而异，传统对齐方法将分歧简化为多数信号，忽视少数观点。

Method: 提出学习多奖励函数分布，直接从未标记的成对偏好中学习，将标注者分歧视为信息性软标签。

Result: 实验证明，即使小规模无异常值的集成也能准确表示多样化偏好分布，校准效果提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能更忠实地反映多元化价值观，校准效果显著。

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICRL prompting的新方法，通过多轮提示和反馈机制，使大型语言模型（LLM）在推理时表现出类似强化学习（RL）的行为，从而提升任务完成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在推理时是否能够通过上下文反馈机制自发地表现出RL行为，以提升任务性能。

Method: 提出ICRL prompting框架，通过多轮提示和数值反馈（奖励）逐步优化LLM的响应。

Result: 在Game of 24、创意写作和ScienceWorld等基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法，甚至在LLM自我生成奖励信号时仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting为LLM在推理时实现类似RL的行为提供了新范式，展示了扩展测试时计算资源的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

Motivation: 极端事件罕见但破坏性强，数据稀缺导致建模困难，合成数据生成成为解决方案，但现有研究未针对极端事件的独特需求。

Method: 系统回顾生成建模技术和大型语言模型，提出评估框架，包括统计、依赖、视觉和任务导向指标。

Result: 总结了基准数据集，分析了指标在极端事件中的适用性，并分类了关键应用领域和未探索方向。

Conclusion: 提出了开放挑战，为极端事件合成数据研究提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Result: 实验证明正交变换编码在泛化和外推能力上优于传统正弦编码。

Conclusion: 该研究为Transformer理论提供了重要补充，指导了位置编码方法的设计选择。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现，分子编码器的中间层嵌入比最终层嵌入在ADMET属性预测任务中表现更好，固定嵌入和微调中间层可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战仅依赖最终层嵌入的标准做法，探索分子编码器各层的潜力以提升性能。

Method: 对五种分子编码器进行分层分析，测试22种ADMET属性预测任务，比较固定嵌入和微调中间层的效果。

Result: 中间层嵌入平均提升5.4%，微调后平均提升8.5%，部分任务提升高达40.8%。

Conclusion: 利用分子编码器的完整表示深度可显著提升性能和计算效率，建议采用评估后微调的方法。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

### [428] [Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety Assurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06444)
*Ruizhong Qiu,Gaotang Li,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAFFRON的新型推理扩展范式，专注于提升大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性，解决了传统推理扩展在安全场景中的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证研究主要关注训练阶段的调整，但易受越狱攻击；推理扩展在提升推理能力的同时，安全性未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON范式，引入多叉奖励模型（MRM）减少奖励模型评估次数，并结合部分监督训练目标、保守探索约束和Trie缓存策略。

Result: 实验验证了SAFFRON的有效性，并公开了模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全性提供了高效解决方案，填补了推理扩展在安全领域的空白。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project
homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

*Antonio Jesús Banegas-Luna,Horacio Pérez-Sánchez,Carlos Martínez-Cortés*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的共识方法WISCA，用于整合机器学习模型的可解释性结果，以提高解释的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和高风险领域中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要，但现有解释方法常产生冲突结果，需要共识策略来统一。

Method: 使用六种模型和合成数据集，结合多种模型无关解释技术，提出WISCA方法（加权缩放共识归因）。

Result: WISCA与最可靠的个体方法一致，验证了共识策略在提高解释可靠性方面的价值。

Conclusion: WISCA是一种有效的共识方法，可提升机器学习模型解释的可靠性。

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

*Alex Havrilla,Edward Hughes,Mikayel Samvelyan,Jacob Abernethy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPARQ提出了一种通过质量-多样性算法生成高质量、多样化数学问题的方法，仅需单一模型即可实现，显著提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型模型或自然问题，限制了复杂问题领域的扩展性。

Method: 利用问题解决率作为难度代理，从7.5K种子数据生成2000万问题-答案对，并通过难度和多样性筛选数据。

Result: 模型性能提升24%，高质量数据提升分布内性能，多样性数据增强分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARQ展示了合成数据生成的可扩展性，验证了模型与数据规模对泛化的积极影响。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其推理过程计算成本高且能耗大，难以在资源受限的环境中部署。

Method: 论文提出了两种策略：(i) 路由（动态选择最适合的模型）和 (ii) 分层推理（逐步升级模型直至获得可靠响应）。

Result: 通过比较分析，这两种策略在关键性能指标上表现良好，能够显著减少计算资源的使用。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注更快的响应时间、基于任务复杂度的自适应模型选择，以及跨异构环境的可扩展部署，以使基于LMs的系统更高效和实用。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为E2H Reasoner的方法，通过从易到难的课程学习提升语言模型的推理能力，实验证明其在小规模语言模型上效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，仅用强化学习提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力效果有限，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难的任务调度（E2H），逐步构建推理能力，并通过理论分析验证其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小规模语言模型的推理能力，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 从易到难的课程学习是提升语言模型推理能力的有效方法，尤其适用于小规模模型。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的分层协作方法，用于多无人机（UAV）在动态和受限环境中的联合运动与通信控制。实验表明，该方法在系统奖励、运营成本和碰撞率方面优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多无人机系统在动态和受限环境中的控制与优化是一个重要挑战，尤其是在集成地面和非地面网络（如高空平台站HAPS）的场景中。

Method: 采用分层协作的LLM框架，HAPS上的LLM负责无人机接入控制，每架无人机上的LLM处理运动规划与控制。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在系统奖励、运营成本和碰撞率方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的知识驱动范式为下一代3D空中高速公路系统的开发提供了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

TL;DR: MarginSel是一种通过选择困难示例来优化ICL的方法，显著提升了LLM的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果对示例选择和顺序敏感，需要一种自适应的方法来优化性能。

Method: 提出MarginSel，两步法选择困难示例，适应每个测试实例。

Result: 在分类任务中F1分数提升2-7%，理论分析表明其通过增加边界效果优化决策。

Conclusion: MarginSel通过选择困难示例有效提升LLM性能，类似支持向量机机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖特征，无法捕捉基本图结构信息，需要更强大的描述符。

Method: 提出SpectRe，将谱信息融入持久同调图，并分析其局部稳定性。

Result: SpectRe在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，增强了图模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: SpectRe是一种更强大的拓扑描述符，具有局部稳定性，可提升图模型性能。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

Result: 实验显示，GAGA在仅需1%标注数据的情况下，分类准确率与或优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAGA是一种高效且低成本的TAG表示学习方法，显著减少了标注需求。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过图像特征和持续学习，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了负载监测性能。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，恶意查询中的风格模式会显著提高大型语言模型（LLM）的攻击成功率（ASR），且ASR与风格模式的长度及模型的注意力相关。通过风格微调会增加模型对相同风格攻击的脆弱性，而提出的防御策略SafeStyle能有效维持模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨风格模式是否影响LLM的安全性，以及如何通过风格对齐增加模型脆弱性，并提出有效的防御方法。

Method: 评估32个LLM在七个越狱基准测试中的表现，分析风格模式对ASR的影响，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格模式显著提高ASR，且与风格长度和模型注意力相关；风格微调增加脆弱性；SafeStyle在多种设置下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 风格模式对LLM安全性有显著影响，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐方法反应滞后，无法应对新兴威胁，需转向主动协同进化。

Method: 采用两玩家零和博弈框架，模型在攻击者和防御者角色间切换，通过奖励模型裁决结果。

Result: 相比静态方法，Self-RedTeam发现更多样化攻击（+21.8% SBERT）并提升鲁棒性（如WildJailBreak +65.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究提倡从被动修补转向主动协同进化，通过多智能体强化学习实现语言模型的自主安全提升。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Motivation: 解决CoM中子链仅依赖前驱信息导致长距离依赖丢失的问题，提升全局上下文流动。

Method: 将隐式令牌表示映射为可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵，结合因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，通过干预一致性损失和自演化门实现动态平衡。

Result: 实验证明GoCE增强了Transformer捕捉长距离因果依赖的能力，并提升了自演化能力，优于基线LLMs。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅优于CoM设计，还为因果学习和持续自适应改进提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

Conclusion: SPT和Sequence Score技术为蛋白质功能预测和生物学智能解释提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from
basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset
curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and
evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search
(HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and
execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

*Adam Breuer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的非梯度组合方法，用于推断LDA主题模型中每个文档的主题分配，实现了对数并行计算时间内的收敛，比现有算法快指数级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LDA主题模型在社会科学、数据探索和因果推断中的主要推断问题。

Method: 采用非梯度组合方法估计主题模型，确保算法在并行计算中快速收敛。

Result: 算法在语义质量上优于现有LDA、神经主题模型和基于LLM的模型，并提供可解释性保证。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效且可解释，还能保持独立性假设，适用于因果推断研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

*Michael K. Chen,Xikun Zhang,Jiaxing Huang,Dacheng Tao*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAFT的新方法，通过多标记训练改进LLMs的概念理解能力，显著优于传统单标记预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的标记预测范式限制了其对连贯高级概念的理解，阻碍了类人智能的发展。

Method: 引入概念感知微调（CAFT），通过多标记序列学习提升模型的概念理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAFT在文本摘要和蛋白质设计等任务中表现显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CAFT首次将多标记预测引入训练后阶段，为研究社区提供了更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在序列建模任务中，最小非线性通常足够且最优，使模型更简单、稳健和可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨非线性在循环网络中的功能角色，明确其计算必要性和机制。

Method: 使用几乎线性循环神经网络（AL-RNNs）作为建模工具和内存机制探针。

Result: 在多种任务中，最小非线性不仅足够，还通常最优，优于完全非线性或线性模型。

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供了理论框架，对人工和生物神经系统有启示。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

*Qinting Jiang,Chuyang Ye,Dongyan Wei,Bingli Wang,Yuan Xue,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIND方法通过特征解耦和自适应批归一化，显著提升了动态分布变化下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练与测试分布变化时性能下降，现有方法难以应对动态多分布场景。

Method: 提出FIND方法，包括LFD、FABN和S-FABN，分别实现特征解耦、自适应归一化和选择性优化。

Result: FIND在动态场景中准确率提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过分层特征处理和自适应归一化，有效解决了动态分布变化的挑战。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最优传输方法在逆强化学习中虽有效，但引入了算法复杂性和超参数敏感性，因此探索更简单的方法。

Method: 提出两种启发式奖励函数：最小距离奖励和分段匹配奖励，避免优化问题，复杂度低且易实现。

Result: 在32个基准测试中，两种简单方法表现优于或匹配最优传输方法。

Conclusion: 最优传输的核心优势可能源于基本对齐而非复杂耦合，未来设计应重新评估复杂性。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

Result: 实验证明IMPA-HGAE在异构图数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂图场景中利用元路径引导的结构语义进行鲁棒表示学习提供了新思路，并探讨了生成式自监督学习在异构图中的未来方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分衡量LLM在推理和问题解决中的能力，需更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 通过HeuriGym框架，LLM提出启发式算法，接收代码执行反馈并迭代优化。

Result: 测试9个前沿模型，发现其在工具使用、规划和自适应推理方面存在局限，QYI得分最高仅0.6。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际问题解决能力提供了更有效的评估基准。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of
artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models
remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in

Result: 在三个大规模集成仿真数据集上，FA-INR实现了最佳保真度，同时显著减小了模型规模。

Conclusion: FA-INR在准确性和紧凑性之间建立了新的平衡，为基于INR的代理模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

Motivation: 稀疏化神经网络常伴随性能下降，现有方法难以恢复原始性能。受鲁棒优化研究启发，目标是找到同时稀疏且平坦的子网络。

Method: 将剪枝问题建模为稀疏约束优化问题，以平坦性为目标，采用增强拉格朗日对偶方法求解，并提出广义投影操作。

Result: SAFE在图像分类和语言建模任务中表现优异，稀疏网络的泛化性能优于基线方法，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAFE方法通过结合稀疏性和平坦性，有效提升了剪枝后网络的性能，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Motivation: 传统显式表示（如对象描述符或3D分割图）存在离散、易产生空洞和噪声的问题，限制了新类发现的准确性。

Method: NeurNCD采用Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度，结合特征查询、调制和聚类等关键组件，实现高效的语义嵌入和视觉嵌入空间聚合。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上，NeurNCD显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注数据或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界新类发现提供了一种高效且数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica

Conclusion: 该方法为图数据中的不确定性估计提供了一种新思路，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with

essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we

evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in

involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal
sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid
quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)
architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By
integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing
component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation
and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of
14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST

quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有黑盒攻击方法中，显著提升了非对称成本场景下的攻击效率。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

*Pengfei Hu,Xiaoxue Han,Fei Wang,Yue Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于医学本体论的层次化框架UdonCare，用于解决临床预测中的领域泛化问题，通过迭代修剪细粒度领域并分离领域相关信号，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床预测中患者数据分布变化导致模型性能下降，而传统领域泛化方法因缺乏领域标签和忽视临床知识而效果不佳。

Method: 利用ICD-9-CM层次结构分组疾病，提出UdonCare框架，通过迭代修剪领域、编码和Siamese推理机制分离领域信号。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，UdonCare在领域差距显著时表现优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: UdonCare展示了医学知识在提升领域泛化性能中的潜力，为实际医疗应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过模型编辑增强低资源语言识别的方法，优于传统元学习，显著提升了新字母表和跨域评估的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型对新数据分布的泛化能力。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术，结合领域合并策略，避免对数据分布或原型需求的依赖。

Result: 实验显示，在相同训练数据下，新字母表的迁移学习和跨域评估性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源字母表的识别提供了新思路，扩展了文档识别的应用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

TL;DR: MoXGATE是一种新型深度学习框架，通过跨注意力和可学习模态权重整合多组学数据，显著提升癌症亚型分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症亚型分类对个性化治疗和预后评估至关重要，但多组学数据的异质性导致有效整合困难。

Method: 提出Modality-Aware Cross-Attention MoXGATE框架，利用跨注意力和模态权重实现多组学特征融合。

Result: 在GIAC和BRCA数据集上达到95%分类准确率，优于现有方法，且能泛化至其他癌症类型。

Conclusion: MoXGATE在多组学癌症亚型分类中表现优异，具有高性能和生物学泛化能力。

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决国际水域非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）中的GPS欺骗问题，现有方法因忽略时空依赖性和物理知识导致高误报率。

Method: 结合运动学约束的物理信息扩散模型，识别不符合物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在海上和城市领域的真实数据集中，预测准确率更高，估计错误率更低。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在异常检测和轨迹生成方面优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

<details>

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但其大尺寸导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用基于GAN的对抗训练框架，每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和一个分类器，通过对抗训练使中间层特征接近最终层特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持性能的同时，推理速度提升超过1.51倍，并有效缓解了过度思考和中间危机现象。

Conclusion: FREE方法通过输入自适应推理显著提升了VLMs的效率和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过后处理或推理满足约束，且依赖分布假设，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用DPPL结合神经网络架构，直接学习系统并满足硬约束，支持非线性约束和不确定性量化。

Result: 在偏微分方程学习和时间序列预测中展示了广泛适用性，优于依赖分布假设的现有方法。

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E是一个灵活且鲁棒的通用框架，适用于多种领域，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

TL;DR: AlphaSteer是一种基于理论的方法，通过激活导向提升LLM的安全性，同时保留其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM能够拒绝恶意提示（如越狱攻击）是安全可靠使用的关键，但现有方法在安全性和实用性之间存在权衡。

Method: AlphaSteer将激活导向视为可学习过程，通过两个学习目标（实用性保留和安全性增强）构建导向向量。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaSteer显著提升了LLM的安全性，且未损害其通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer是一种理论扎实且实证有效的方法，解决了安全性与实用性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Result: 实验验证PGTS在多种MDP环境中表现优异，能避开局部陷阱并找到更优解。

Conclusion: PGTS通过树搜索机制显著提升策略梯度方法的性能，尤其在复杂环境中表现突出。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效解决了现有RLVR方法在多模态感知能力上的不足，显著提升了MLLMs的推理表现。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

Conclusion: CoFILL为时空数据填补提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/joyHJL/CoFILL.

Conclusion: 结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间，为通用BBO算法的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

Motivation: 现有对比学习存在嵌入分布缺乏明确调控和过度依赖大批量负样本的问题，导致语义相关实例被错误分离且泛化能力受限。

Method: VarCon将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类变量的变分推断，最大化后验加权的证据下界（ELBO），实现高效的类感知匹配和精细控制类内分散。

Result: 在多个数据集上，VarCon达到SOTA性能（如ImageNet-1K上79.36% Top-1准确率），并表现出更清晰的决策边界和语义组织。

Conclusion: VarCon通过变分推断优化对比学习，显著提升了性能和鲁棒性，尤其在少样本学习和泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为可靠策略迭代（RPI）的新算法，解决了在函数逼近下策略迭代的单调性保证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）研究多年，但在函数逼近下正确使用RL算法仍具挑战性，尤其是策略迭代的单调性保证失效。

Method: RPI通过贝尔曼约束优化替代传统的投影或贝尔曼误差最小化，确保值估计的单调性并下界真实回报。

Result: RPI在经典控制任务中不仅保持下界保证，还匹配或超越所有基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，适用于模型无关的RL实现。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like

to occlusions and view ambiguities*. However, addressing challenges presents
both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view
probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture
*invariant content* information while simultaneously learning disentangled
global *viewpoint-level* information. Unlike prior single-view methods, our
approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for
identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments

robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Result: 在四个大规模真实交通数据集上，RAGL在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGL通过正则化和高效计算机制，显著提升了交通预测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能减少过度思考，提高答案准确性，并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 通过调节推理长度，可以有效优化LLMs的显式思维过程，提升性能。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

scaling trends influenced by HMM properties, and offer theoretical conjectures
for these empirical observations. We also provide practical guidelines for
scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型部署提供了高效解决方案，并开源了完整实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to

Result: Raudra多任务设计表现最稳健，但每种架构在速度、可解释性和资源需求上有独特权衡。

Conclusion: JavelinGuard为实际LLM安全应用提供了复杂性与效率的最佳平衡选择。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each

Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法因无法访问模型参数或架构而不可行，SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上表现优于微调方法，训练延迟更低，适应性强。

Conclusion: SALT为边缘AI系统提供了一种实用的个性化推理解决方案，部署开销低。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分数阶矩阵微分方法（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），兼容自动微分技术，并设计了分数阶Autograd技术，验证了其在深度学习中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于分数阶微分在神经网络优化中的潜力未被充分挖掘，且缺乏与自动微分技术兼容的理论方法，因此需要提出一种新的分数阶矩阵微分方法。

Method: 基于整数阶雅可比矩阵定义，提出分数阶雅可比矩阵微分（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），并设计分数阶Autograd技术，应用于深度学习隐藏层。

Result: 实验通过替换多层感知机中的nn.Linear为FLinear，验证了${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集、验证集和测试集上的优越性能，以及时间和GPU内存的高效性。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$是一种优秀的分数阶梯度下降方法，显著提升了分数阶微分在深度学习中的实用性。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于证据深度学习（EDL）的动态图OOD检测方法EviSEC，通过重新定义输出为后验Dirichlet分布和频谱感知对比学习，解决了单点估计的高偏差高方差问题以及OOD训练数据缺乏导致的分数同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域备受关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，面临单点估计的高偏差高方差问题以及OOD训练数据缺乏导致的分数同质化问题。

Method: 提出EviSEC，通过证据神经网络将输出重新定义为后验Dirichlet分布，并结合频谱感知增强模块生成OOD近似数据，以扩大ID和OOD数据间的分数差距。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过结合EDL和频谱感知对比学习，显著提升了动态图中OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署中缺乏系统区分和应对不确定性的工具，导致保守策略（如拒绝高不确定性输出）限制了其潜力。

Method: 采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性提供一致的理论基础，并支持主动解决（如请求澄清、检索外部信息）。

Result: 该框架使LLM及其用户能采取情境适当的步骤，提升系统的可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架为LLM在高风险场景中的部署提供了更可靠、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络在自动推理中取得进展，但将其整合到实际验证工作流仍具挑战性。Lean缺乏高效的工具（hammer），阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出LeanHammer，基于神经前提选择系统，动态适应用户上下文，并与符号证明搜索和重构结合。

Result: 评估显示，LeanHammer比现有前提选择器多解决21%的目标，且能泛化到不同领域。

Conclusion: LeanHammer填补了神经检索与符号推理间的空白，使形式验证更易用。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习目标可能损害长期性能，因为其与奖励最大化不一致。作者希望通过先验数据仅指导探索，避免显式行为克隆约束。

Method: 提出Data-Guided Noise (DGN)框架，通过噪声引导策略探索，利用演示数据识别应探索的动作。

Result: 在七个模拟连续控制任务中，DGN方法比现有离线数据强化学习方法性能提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: DGN通过避免直接模仿学习约束，有效利用先验数据提升探索效率，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在动态概率模型中使用top-p状态加速推理的方法，显著减少计算量且误差可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态概率模型推理复杂且计算量大，尤其是隐马尔可夫模型中需枚举所有状态，导致效率低下和噪声增加。

Method: 仅使用累积概率为p的最可能状态（top-p状态）进行推理，以减少噪声和提升速度。

Result: 实验表明速度提升至少一个数量级，总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: top-p状态方法在保证误差可控的同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的联邦学习（FL）算法FedCGD，通过最小化设备级和样本级集体梯度发散（CGD）之和，优化FL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有设备调度策略仅关注单个设备的数据异质性，而忽略了设备组和样本级的梯度发散对FL收敛速度的影响。

Method: 通过将设备级CGD转化为加权地球移动距离（WEMD），并结合样本级CGD的统计上界，提出FedCGD算法，平衡WEMD和采样方差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCGD将分类准确率提升4.2%，同时减少41.8%的设备调度。

Conclusion: FedCGD通过多级CGD优化，显著提升了FL的性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

Result: 显著降低计算负担，优化配置，提升效率。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT是一种高效、可扩展的PEFT策略搜索方法。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: GAS通过图搜索和状态聚类显著提升了离线分层强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: 该研究为安全关键领域开发可信赖且鲁棒的深度学习模型提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to

novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的理论框架，用于分析公平性泛化误差，并通过Efron-Stein不等式推导出紧致的公平性泛化界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对公平性在训练数据与未见数据之间泛化能力的理论保证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用信息论视角，基于Efron-Stein不等式，结合互信息（MI）和条件互信息（CMI）推导公平性泛化界限。

Result: 实验验证了所提界限的紧致性和实际相关性，适用于多种公平性学习算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计改进公平性泛化的算法提供了有价值的理论指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决1型糖尿病管理中血糖预测模型在可穿戴设备上部署的计算和内存限制问题。

Method: 结合Transformer的注意力机制和循环神经网络的序列处理能力，设计轻量级模型，并采用平衡损失函数处理数据不平衡。

Result: 在OhioT1DM和DiaTrend数据集上表现优于现有方法，能有效预测血糖水平和检测不良事件。

Conclusion: 该模型填补了高性能建模与实际部署之间的空白，为1型糖尿病管理提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的测试时间交互扩展方法（TTI），通过增加代理的交互范围，使其能够执行探索、回溯和动态重新规划等行为，从而提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时间扩展方法仅依赖生成长推理轨迹（“思考”更多），但无法让代理从环境中获取新信息或随时间调整行为。因此，研究探索了交互扩展这一未被充分利用的维度。

Method: 提出TTI方法，基于课程学习的在线强化学习（RL），通过自适应调整代理的滚动长度来训练代理。使用Gemma 3 12B模型进行实验。

Result: TTI在WebVoyager和WebArena基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了代理能够自适应地平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是计算扩展的强大补充维度，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

TL;DR: G-Memory是一种为多智能体系统设计的层次化记忆架构，通过三层图层次结构管理交互，显著提升了任务成功率和知识问答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统的记忆机制过于简单，缺乏跨试验和智能体特定的定制化，限制了其自我进化能力。

Method: 引入G-Memory，一种基于组织记忆理论的三层图层次结构（洞察图、查询图和交互图），通过双向记忆遍历检索高层次的通用洞察和细粒度的交互轨迹。

Result: 在五个基准测试、三种LLM骨干和三种流行MAS框架中，G-Memory将任务成功率提升至多20.89%，知识问答准确性提升至多10.12%。

Conclusion: G-Memory通过改进记忆架构，显著提升了多智能体系统的性能，无需修改原有框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多数支持提案与现状之间寻找妥协的开放性问题，特别是在民主文本编辑等传统工具受限的领域。

Method: 结合自然语言处理和大语言模型构建语义度量空间，设计算法生成可能获得广泛支持的妥协点。

Result: 通过模拟联盟形成过程，验证了AI在大规模民主文本编辑中的有效性。

Conclusion: AI方法能够有效支持大规模协作文档写作，弥补传统工具的不足。

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

Result: 提高了可靠性，减少了幻觉风险，支持临床和教育用途的交互式报告。

Conclusion: MedChat通过多代理框架有效解决了医学影像诊断中的LLM局限性，具有临床和教育潜力。

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体规划算法在适应性和协作能力上存在不足，需要一种能够动态学习和进化的方法。

Method: 采用LIET范式，结合个体层面的本地效用函数学习和团队层面的共享知识更新，提升LLM的适应性和协作能力。

Conclusion: LIET框架通过个体与团队的双重学习机制，显著提升了LLM在多智能体环境中的规划与协作能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，LLM智能体易因缺乏协调规则而自利行为，亟需公平信用分配和定价机制以促进协作。

Method: 结合Shapley Chain-of-Thought（基于边际贡献定价）与结构化谈判协议，实现任务定价和奖励再分配。

Result: 在多个多智能体任务中验证，Shapley-Coop显著提升协作效果，公平分配信用。

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop通过合理定价机制有效解决信用分配问题，促进LLM智能体协作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨集体决策中责任扩散的问题，旨在找到避免责任扩散的机制。

Method: 通过定义决策机制的互模拟，证明互模拟保留责任相关属性，并在最小的互模拟机制中验证结果。

Result: 在两人决策中，避免责任扩散的唯一方式是独裁；多人决策中，需选举单一代理人独裁决策。

Conclusion: 避免责任扩散的集体决策机制必须采用独裁形式。

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在图像诊断任务中表现优异，但忽视了音频特征，且音频数据易受噪声干扰。

Method: 结合六种声学特征提取，引入ARSLIF神经元模型模拟大脑注意力机制，增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在MODMA数据集上取得0.8750至0.8974的精度指标，并在AVEC2014和DAIC-WOZ数据集上验证了噪声鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: RBA-FE在抑郁症音频诊断中表现出色，ARSLIF模型提供了脑启发的可解释性。

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统在复杂环境（如电视剧）中表现不佳，现有方法未能充分利用视频中的丰富信息。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：ASR生成和基于视频的后校正，结合VLMM和LLM模型提取并利用视频上下文信息。

Result: 在电视剧ASR多模态基准测试中，该方法显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 视频上下文信息能有效提升ASR在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

Motivation: 现有方法通常独立学习音频和视觉特征，未能充分利用其相关性，且模型冗余，不适用于资源受限环境。

Method: 设计单流网络，引入协作音频-视觉学习块和多模态分类模块，实现高效特征融合与轻量化设计。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，仅需0.48M参数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，适用于多种深度伪造类型，包括未见过的类型。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Conclusion: LeVo通过创新设计和优化方法，显著提升了歌词到歌曲生成的质量和音乐性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is
computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an
efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional

centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and
demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based
centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding
allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and

often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

TL;DR: ResPF提出了一种基于Poisson Flow的稀疏视图CT重建方法，通过条件引导和残差融合模块提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT能减少辐射剂量，但重建问题复杂，现有深度学习和扩散模型缺乏物理可解释性或计算成本高。

Method: 基于PFGM++，ResPF引入条件引导和残差融合模块，跳过冗余步骤并保持数据一致性。

Result: 实验表明，ResPF在重建质量、推理速度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResPF首次将Poisson Flow模型应用于稀疏视图CT，展示了高效和高质量的重建能力。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

*Sumit Sharma,Gopi Raju Matta,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，将二进制SPC图像转换为高质量彩色新视图，解决了传统3D合成技术因信息丢失而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPC图像具有高时间精度，但二进制特性导致纹理和颜色信息严重丢失，传统3D合成技术难以应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Pix2PixHD进行图像到图像转换，第二阶段使用NeRF或3DGS进行3D场景重建。

Result: 实验验证了该框架在感知质量和几何一致性上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了SPC图像的信息丢失问题，为高质量3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Conclusion: 深度学习与XAI结合可有效提升脑肿瘤检测，适用于资源有限地区的临床实践。

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and
identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical
technologies.

Method: 提出TMC网络，引入多阶段交叉注意力模块增强语义细节理解，并使用多阶段对齐损失提升跨模态语义一致性。

Result: TMC在三个公开数据集（QaTa-COV19、MosMedData和Breast）上Dice分数分别为84.77%、78.50%和88.73%，优于UNet和现有文本引导方法。

Conclusion: TMC通过增强跨模态交互和语义一致性，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Motivation: 现有神经B帧编码器直接采用P帧工具，未能解决B帧压缩的独特挑战，导致性能不佳。

Method: 设计了细粒度运动压缩方法（交互式双分支运动自编码器）和选择性时间融合方法（预测双向融合权重）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有神经B帧编码器，性能接近或超过H.266/VVC参考软件。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了B帧压缩的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤生成文档中的虚假内容并优化组合，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算强度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中性能依赖模型规模，成本高且计算密集。GOLFer旨在利用小型开源模型解决这些问题。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除生成文档中的非事实和不一致内容）和文档组合器（通过权重向量优化查询与内容的结合）。

Result: 在三个网页搜索和十个低资源数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer在小型模型上表现优于其他方法，并与大型LLMs方法竞争。

Conclusion: GOLFer证明了利用小型开源模型进行高效查询扩展的可行性，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有方法未能捕捉文档内在的话语结构，限制了长文档理解的效果。DISRetrieval旨在通过语言学结构提升检索和问答任务的性能。

Method: 1. 使用RST理论构建句子级层次表示；2. 结合LLM和自适应摘要增强节点表示；3. 设计层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上，DISRetrieval在检索指标和问答任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语言学结构对长文档理解至关重要，DISRetrieval为未来研究提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域提供了高效的BERT解决方案，弥补了LLMs的不足，并为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five

TL;DR: 本文研究了检索增强生成（RAG）在阿拉伯语中的优化，通过实验评估了多种组件（如分块策略、嵌入模型、重排序器和语言模型），并提供了构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道的实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG在高资源语言中已有研究，但阿拉伯语的RAG组件优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用RAGAS框架，系统评估了分块策略、嵌入模型、重排序器和语言模型在阿拉伯语数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，句子感知分块效果最佳，BGE-M3和Multilingual-E5-large是最佳嵌入模型，重排序器显著提升复杂数据集的忠实度，Aya-8B生成质量优于StableLM。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出NR4DER方法，通过改进练习推荐系统，解决高辍学率和学习节奏不匹配问题，提高推荐准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育平台普及，但现有练习推荐方法难以适应学生多样化学习节奏，导致高辍学率和推荐效果不佳。

Method: NR4DER结合mLSTM模型优化练习筛选模块，采用序列增强方法提升非活跃学生表征，并通过神经重排序生成个性化推荐列表。

Result: 实验表明，NR4DER在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并能有效适应学生多样化学习节奏。

Conclusion: NR4DER通过改进推荐系统，显著提升了推荐准确性和多样性，适应了学生个性化学习需求。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based

modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of
0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability
as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the

Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖扁平化检索，未能充分利用用户-物品交互的关系结构。

Method: 扩展LlamaRec架构，引入轻量级用户偏好模块，动态识别知识图谱中的关键关系路径，并将其整合到Llama-2模型中。

Result: 在ML-100K和Amazon Beauty数据集上，MRR、NDCG和Recall等指标显著优于LlamaRec。

Conclusion: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG证明了结构化推理在LLM推荐中的价值，为下一代推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its

Motivation: 传统方法（如MLoRA）在跨域用户行为处理上缺乏灵活性，需要更灵活的框架以适应多样化的用户行为。

Method: 提出MoE-MLoRA框架，先独立训练专家以专注于各自领域，再通过门控网络动态加权专家贡献。

Result: 在Movielens和Taobao数据集上测试，MoE-MLoRA在动态数据集上性能提升显著（Taobao-20上加权AUC提高1.45），但在低多样性数据集上效果有限。

Conclusion: 专家混合架构在多域推荐系统中具有潜力，任务感知的专业化和自适应门控可提升复杂环境下的预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training
simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of
images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent
increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous
values of weights and thresholds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微电网间能源交易的动态平衡问题，通过本地决策和进化算法优化能源分配。

Method: 将每个微电网建模为自主代理，采用Hawk或Dove策略，并通过进化算法（包括重组和变异操作）优化能源交易矩阵。

Result: 在100个微电网的模拟场景中，95个达到了稳定能源状态，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型在个体和社区层面均能有效实现能源平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Conclusion: 生物合理学习规则在任务性能和神经数据相似性上取得显著进展，潜力巨大。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子硬件对CX门的连接性有限制，且CX门噪声较大，因此需要优化布局合成以减少CX门数量或深度。

Method: 采用增量SAT求解和并行计划，提出了一种高效的SAT编码方法，专注于最小化电路深度或CX门深度。

Result: 新方法比OLSQ2快10-100倍，但优化深度仍比Q-Synth优化门数量耗时更长。实验表明，同时优化CX数量和深度能最好地降低噪声。

Conclusion: 优化CX数量和深度能更有效地减少噪声，新方法在速度和效果上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

Motivation: 解决从噪声数据构建的逆问题中的正则化难题，特别是在超分辨率成像中，加速成像过程并提升图像质量。

Method: 采用两步训练策略：先用低分辨率正则化图训练网络，再通过优化Tikhonov损失函数调整预测结果。

Result: 方法显著加速成像过程，并在复杂环境中提升图像对比度和质量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需先验知识即可生成高质量正则化图，适用于实时成像和复杂环境。

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing

hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time,
verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel
framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By
leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool
invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array

interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,

data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到训练中活跃张量仅占GPU内存的1.7%，不活跃张量长期未被使用，为卸载/预取提供了机会。

Method: 通过分析张量生命周期生成优化计划，并集成到PyTorch中，利用GPUDirect存储直接迁移张量。

Result: 相比现有技术，TERAIO平均提升训练性能1.47倍，达到理想性能的80.7%。

Conclusion: TERAIO有效利用SSD扩展GPU内存，显著提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结构化概念框架，用于理解AI对齐问题，区分了对齐目标、范围和选民，为跨领域整合提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，确保AI代理在现实世界中安全且符合规范成为紧迫任务，但现有领域（如AI安全、AI对齐和机器伦理）之间的界限模糊，缺乏明确指导。

Method: 作者开发了一个结构化概念框架，通过分类对齐目标（如安全性、伦理性）、范围（结果与执行）和选民（个体与集体）来解决问题。

Result: 该框架揭示了多种合理的对齐配置，为跨领域实践和哲学整合提供了基础，并明确了“全面对齐”的含义。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI对齐领域提供了清晰的分类和整合框架，有助于指导未来研究和实践。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;
and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在国际人道法框架下的合规性，确保其拒绝违法请求的能力和解释的清晰度，以提升AI系统的安全性和透明度。

Method: 评估8种LLM对明确违反IHL的提示的拒绝能力，分析其回应的清晰度和一致性，并测试标准化安全提示的效果。

Result: 多数模型能拒绝违法请求，但回应质量不一；标准化提示显著提升解释质量，但复杂请求仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 标准化干预可提升LLM的合规性和透明度，但需进一步解决复杂请求的漏洞，为AI系统安全性和IHL合规性提供基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

Motivation: 提高对突发性灾害（如地震）的主动准备能力，探索LLMs在复杂场景模拟中的潜力。

Method: 使用多模态数据集（地理空间、社会经济、建筑和街景图像数据），结合RAG和ICL技术，生成地震烈度预测。

Result: 在2014年纳帕和2019年里奇克莱斯特地震中，预测与USGS报告高度相关（0.88），RMSE低至0.77。

Conclusion: LLMs在地震影响模拟中表现出潜力，有助于灾前规划。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突发事件后，专家判断易受结果影响，难以还原事件前的感知。传统测量方法失效时，需要替代方案。

Method: 使用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构的意识形态分数，并与裁员目标关联分析。

Result: LLMs复现了裁员前的专家测量结果，并预测了裁员目标，同时发现知识机构感知也是影响因素。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为专家调查的替代方案，论文提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模拟社会行为时缺乏内部一致性、因果推理和信念可追溯性，限制了其在分析人类推理和干预响应中的可靠性。

Method: 提出GenMinds范式，结合认知科学设计结构化信念表示；开发RECAP框架评估代理的推理保真度，包括因果追溯、人口统计基础和干预一致性。

Result: GenMinds和RECAP框架能够提升生成代理的推理能力，使其更适用于社会模拟。

Conclusion: 从表面模仿转向模拟思维的生成代理，是提升社会模拟可靠性的关键方向。

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just
language -- for social simulations.

cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we
explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources,
demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By
analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and

Motivation: 探索私有GPT如何利用需求（如验收标准）自动生成高质量的测试代码，为产品负责人或业务智能提供直接生成可测试标准的方法。

Method: 直接让LLM从需求生成代码，或通过Gherkin语法中间步骤生成代码，比较两种方法的效果。

Result: 两步法（通过Gherkin语法）生成的测试代码质量更高，表现为更好的可读性和编码实践。

Conclusion: 结构化提示（如Gherkin语法）能显著提高测试代码的输出质量。

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Conclusion: 统一分类法不仅支持量子软件工程的研究，还优化了开发流程、提升语言兼容性，并促进了量子编程的最佳实践。

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

TL;DR: IntenTest是一个API为中心的测试框架，用于发现LLM代理中的意图完整性违规，通过语义分区和突变测试提高测试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在通过自然语言指令调用API时容易误解用户意图，传统测试方法无法处理自然语言的模糊性。

Method: IntenTest基于工具包文档生成真实任务，应用目标突变测试，并通过语义分区和轻量级预测器指导测试。

Result: 在80个工具包API上，IntenTest显著优于基线，能有效暴露错误并适应强模型和演化的API。

Conclusion: IntenTest能高效发现LLM代理的意图违规，适用于动态API环境。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

Result: 形式化证明了无法同时满足四个基本属性：真实生成、语义信息守恒、相关知识揭示和知识约束最优性。

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.

*Fahad Mostafa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于LSTM网络的统一统计框架，解决模型选择问题，包括超参数调优、架构规范和正则化选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LSTM在序列数据建模中广泛应用，但模型选择问题仍依赖启发式方法且计算成本高。

Method: 扩展经典模型选择思想（如信息准则和收缩估计）到序列神经网络，提出惩罚似然、广义阈值方法和高效估计策略。

Result: 在多个生物医学数据示例中展示了框架的灵活性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为LSTM模型选择提供了系统化解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

*Manuel Sage,Khalil Al Handawi,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化Power-to-Gas（P2G）系统的长期经济运营，结合电池储能系统（BESs）和燃气轮机，并通过改进算法解决延迟奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术虽能整合间歇性可再生能源，但其经济运营复杂且效率较低，且现有研究多忽略长期存储能力。DRL在能源系统管理中表现潜力，但面临延迟奖励的挑战。

Method: 研究通过三个逐步复杂的案例，评估了Deep Q-Networks和Proximal Policy Optimization算法，并引入预测整合、奖励函数惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的DRL显著提升了P2G系统的经济运营策略能力，克服了初始决策困难，展现了长期储能潜力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了改进DRL在优化P2G系统长期运营中的有效性，为可再生能源整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端口哈密顿系统中的参数和结构不确定性，同时保持系统固有结构，并提高AI的可解释性和安全性。

Method: 将系统动态分解为右（RHS）和左（LHS）两部分，分别处理哈密顿流和耗散/输入流，通过虚拟端口变量连接，结合非线性控制器和强化学习。

Result: 框架有效管理不确定性，提升性能可调性、AI可解释性，并保证安全性和状态可达性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论研究和实际应用提供了新思路，并通过摆的非线性动力学仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Result: 数值评估表明，该方法在保持安全性的同时避免了过度保守。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多智能体系统中的安全性问题，具有实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知在机器人灵巧操作中潜力巨大，但因其局部性，难以单独完成需要全局场景理解的任务。主动感知技术可以弥补这一不足，但相关领域缺乏标准化基准。

Method: 引入Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，包含多样化的模拟场景和数据集，支持触觉感知任务的标准化评估。

Result: 提供了13,500个合成3D MNIST数字模型和153,600个真实触觉样本的数据集，并训练了CycleGAN用于逼真的触觉模拟渲染。

Conclusion: 该基准套件通过标准化协议和可复现的评估框架，推动了触觉感知和主动感知领域的系统性进展。

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Motivation: 传统验证方法难以应对AI组件的动态性和不可预测性，需要一种新方法来确保CPS的可靠性和安全性。

Method: CPS-Guard通过多角色编排（如安全监控、安全评估、故障注入和恢复规划）在模拟环境中持续评估和优化AI行为。

Result: 案例研究表明，CPS-Guard能有效检测漏洞、管理性能影响并支持自适应恢复策略。

Conclusion: CPS-Guard为安全和关键系统提供了一种结构化且可扩展的严格验证和验证解决方案。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载感知系统因遮挡和盲区精度有限，云端解决方案延迟高，无法满足实时需求。

Method: ECOD框架整合PACE（多车数据聚合）和VOTE（共识投票机制）算法，在边缘服务器上实时运行。

Result: 实验表明ECOD显著提升分类准确率（比传统方法高75%），同时实现低延迟。

Conclusion: 边缘计算可有效提升协作感知能力，适用于延迟敏感的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线训练的VLN策略在陌生环境中性能下降，熵最小化方法可能因错误累积导致过度自信。ATENA旨在通过主动学习解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合熵优化方法，结合动作和伪专家分布优化不确定性；引入自主动学习策略，基于置信预测评估导航结果。

Result: 在REVERIE、R2R和R2R-CE等基准测试中，ATENA显著优于基线方法，克服了测试时的分布偏移问题。

Conclusion: ATENA通过主动学习和不确定性优化，提升了VLN任务在陌生环境中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Result: 在MetaWorld任务和真实机器人任务中，SAIL持续提升性能，且对初始数据质量和过滤方式具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAIL通过结合互联网规模数据和在线学习，为机器人任务提供了一种高效的自适应改进方法。

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Conclusion: DriveSuprim显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性和性能，适用于多样化驾驶场景。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Result: 在X-DAPT数据集上的实验表明，RoboPARA在复杂任务组合中显著优于现有方法，效率更高且更可靠。

Conclusion: RoboPARA通过优化任务并行性，提升了双臂机器人在复杂任务中的协作能力。

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 多模态空间语言地图显著提升了导航代理的感知和交互能力，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Conclusion: NightHawk显著改善了在挑战性光照条件下的视觉估计效果。

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

Conclusion: RoboCerebra推动了更强大、更通用的机器人规划器的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Result: 在仿真和现实实验中，CARoL表现出更快收敛和更高奖励。

Conclusion: CARoL能高效学习新任务并适应现实环境，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Motivation: 传统G-TAMP方法依赖启发式或学习经验，计算资源需求高，而人类利用常识直觉解决问题，启发使用LLM。

Method: 设计基于谓词的提示编码几何信息，利用LLM生成任务计划，结合MCTS搜索连续参数。

Result: 在六个G-TAMP问题上，该方法优于之前的LLM规划器和纯搜索算法。

Conclusion: LLM结合MCTS能有效解决G-TAMP问题，减少计算成本并提高性能。

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Result: 在Gibson基准测试中，MapBERT实现了最先进的语义地图生成，平衡了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MapBERT通过对象感知和比特编码，显著提升了未观察区域的语义建模能力。

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Conclusion: BitVLA展示了在内存受限的边缘设备上部署的潜力，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟和现实场景中具有优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HAPO方法确保了VLA模型的可靠部署和从失败中学习的能力。

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

Conclusion: RTC是一种高效、鲁棒的方法，能够显著改善实时控制任务的性能，适用于高精度任务。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

Result: Delphyne在公开数据集上表现优异，优于现有基础模型和全样本模型。

Conclusion: Delphyne为金融时间序列分析提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

Conclusion: FinAR-Bench为LLMs在金融领域的实际应用提供了更可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,
calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This
structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

### [595] [Recursive Semantic Anchoring in ISO 639:2023: A Structural Extension to ISO/TC 37 Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06870)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归语义锚定方法，用于处理语言代码中的方言漂移和混合问题，通过固定点操作符建模语义漂移，并证明了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISO 639:2023缺乏处理方言漂移和混合的机器原生机制，因此需要一种新的方法来建模和管理语义漂移。

Method: 使用固定点操作符和类别理论，将语义漂移建模为类别中的态射，并通过函子映射到锚定语言。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在语言识别和翻译任务中对噪声或混合输入的准确性更高。

Conclusion: 该框架与ISO/TC 37兼容，为未来标准提供了具有漂移感知能力的语义层。

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自然智能（NI）如何在有限资源下高效学习，并提出通过模拟NI的约束条件（如能量限制、简洁架构）来改进AI的效率与适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然智能（如婴儿学习）在有限数据、能量和神经资源下表现出高效与创造力，而当前AI依赖大量资源。研究旨在探索NI的约束如何成为其优势，并启发AI设计。

Method: 分析了NI的约束如何促进高效编码（如稀疏神经元、分层结构）、混沌游走和储层计算，并结合发展视角讨论内在动机与社会环境的作用。

Result: 研究表明，NI的约束（如带宽限制）能催生简洁但强大的表示与泛化能力，而主动学习和社会互动是高效学习的关键。

Conclusion: 提出通过模拟NI的'少即是多'原则（如能量限制、简洁架构）可开发更高效、可解释且生物启发的AI系统。

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

TL;DR: 研究者开发了一个名为LLM-D12的12项问卷，用于测量人们对大型语言模型（LLM）的依赖性，分为工具依赖和关系依赖两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具主要基于行为成瘾症状，无法全面反映LLM与人类关系的复杂性，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: 基于理论工作开发问卷，收集526名英国参与者的数据，通过探索性和验证性因子分析验证结构。

Result: 问卷分为工具依赖（决策支持）和关系依赖（社交感知）两个维度，具有良好的内部一致性和区分效度。

Conclusion: LLM依赖性不一定是功能失调，但可能在某些情境下引发问题，LLM-D12为研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large
language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even
addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

Motivation: 随着AI技术越来越面向人类，许多呼吁要求采用参与式方法开发AI，但这些呼吁通常只关注主要利益相关者（如终端用户），而忽略了次要利益相关者。本文旨在将参与式AI的理念扩展到更广泛的次要利益相关者群体。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈，研究次要利益相关者如何实现三个参与理想（知情、同意和能动性），并提出了三种利益相关者原型。

Result: 研究发现，次要利益相关者在实现参与理想时需要克服系统性障碍，并提出了三种原型：不情愿的数据贡献者、无支持的活动家和善意的实践者。

Conclusion: 本文展望了一个次要利益相关者能够有意义地参与AI系统的未来，并强调了知情、同意和能动性在实现这一目标中的重要性。

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

TL;DR: MoE-Gyro是一种自监督框架，通过混合专家模型解决MEMS陀螺仪测量范围与噪声性能的权衡问题，显著扩展测量范围并降低噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬件方案复杂且昂贵，深度学习方法依赖精确对齐的真实信号，难以实际部署，未能解决根本问题。

Method: MoE-Gyro包含两个专家模型：ORE（过范围信号重建）和DE（噪声抑制），通过轻量级门控模块动态分配任务。

Result: 测量范围从450 deg/s扩展到1500 deg/s，偏置不稳定性降低98.4%，性能达到最优。

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro有效解决了惯性传感中的长期权衡问题，并通过ISEBench提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Conclusion: 论文提出的RIS-RL系统在公平性和效率方面表现优异，为未来研究提供了代码和数据集支持。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate
strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power.
In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient
and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and
discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code
and datasets to foster further research in the topic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模次声波传输损失对评估国际监测系统性能至关重要，但现有PE方法计算成本高，无法满足实际监测需求。

Method: 采用优化的卷积神经网络，基于全球模拟的温度和风场数据，预测4000公里范围内的TLs，并通过关键优化提升性能。

Result: 优化模型在整个频段（0.1-3.2 Hz）的平均预测误差为8.6 dB，适用于真实大气场景。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算时间，同时保持了较高的预测精度，为次声波监测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

electroencephalography (EEG) research is enabling new directions in neural
decoding, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and affective computing. This
survey offers a systematic review and structured taxonomy of recent
advancements that utilize LLMs for EEG-based analysis and applications. We
organize the literature into four domains: (1) LLM-inspired foundation models
for EEG representation learning, (2) EEG-to-language decoding, (3) cross-modal
generation including image and 3D object synthesis, and (4) clinical
applications and dataset management tools. The survey highlights how
transformer-based architectures adapted through fine-tuning, few-shot, and
zero-shot learning have enabled EEG-based models to perform complex tasks such
as natural language generation, semantic interpretation, and diagnostic
assistance. By offering a structured overview of modeling strategies, system
designs, and application areas, this work serves as a foundational resource for
future work to bridge natural language processing and neural signal analysis

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过传统机器学习和深度学习方法对ECG信号中的心跳进行分类，发现基于手工特征的LightGBM模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ECG信号中心跳分类问题，比较传统手工特征和深度学习图像转换方法的性能差异。

Method: 1. 传统机器学习：提取HRV、均值、方差等特征，训练SVM、随机森林等模型；2. 深度学习方法：将ECG信号转换为图像（GAF、MTF等），用CNN分类。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最优（准确率99%，F1分数0.94），优于基于图像的CNN方法（F1分数0.85）。

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空变化，未来可结合多导联信号和时序依赖提升分类性能。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

TL;DR: TimeWak是一种用于多元时间序列扩散模型的水印算法，直接在真实时空特征中嵌入水印，解决了特征异质性和时间依赖性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水印方法在真实空间中的不兼容性，同时确保数据的高效用性和可追溯性。

Method: 提出TimeWak算法，通过时间链式哈希水印和ε-精确反转技术，直接在真实时空特征中嵌入水印。

Result: TimeWak在合成数据质量、水印可检测性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有基线，提升了61.96%的context-FID分数和8.44%的相关性分数。

Conclusion: TimeWak是首个适用于多元时间序列扩散模型的水印算法，有效解决了真实空间水印嵌入的挑战。

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化框架，设计了两种新的水印方法（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），以在低熵任务中高效检测水印并最小化文本失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）水印在低熵任务（如编码）中检测困难的问题，同时减少对生成文本质量的干扰。

Method: 提出优化框架，设计两种可调水印（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），通过随机侧信息最大化检测概率并最小化文本失真。

Result: 实验表明，两种水印在低熵任务中能高效检测且对文本质量影响小，同时揭示了水印与编码理论的新联系。

Conclusion: HeavyWater和SimplexWater为LLM水印提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，适用于各种任务和模型。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

*Davis Brown,Mahdi Sabbaghi,Luze Sun,Alexander Robey,George J. Pappas,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的语言模型安全评估方法，针对隐蔽攻击和状态防御进行自动化测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估主要关注明显攻击和低风险任务，忽视了通过多个看似无害的查询组合完成危险任务的隐蔽攻击。

Method: 开发了Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD)数据生成管道，用于自动化评估隐蔽攻击及防御措施，并创建了两个新数据集。

Result: 新数据集被前沿模型一致拒绝，但对较弱模型仍具挑战性。分解攻击被发现是有效的滥用手段，状态防御是有效对策。

Conclusion: 隐蔽攻击是实际威胁，状态防御是应对此类攻击的关键。

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

*Xiaoyuan Zhu,Yaowen Ye,Tianyi Qiu,Hanlin Zhu,Sijun Tan,Ajraf Mannan,Jonathan Michala,Raluca Ada Popa,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于秩的统一性测试方法，用于验证黑盒LLM与本地部署的真实模型的行为一致性，解决了API提供商可能暗中替换模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API提供商可能为了降低成本或恶意修改模型行为，暗中提供量化或微调的变体，这会降低性能并威胁安全性。用户缺乏对模型权重和输出logits的访问权限，难以检测此类替换。

Method: 提出了一种基于秩的统一性测试方法，该方法准确、查询高效，且避免了可检测的查询模式，能够对抗检测测试尝试的对抗性提供商。

Result: 在多种威胁场景（如量化、有害微调、越狱提示和完整模型替换）下评估，该方法在有限查询预算下始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效验证黑盒LLM的行为一致性，为模型透明度和安全性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出HauntAttack框架，揭示大型推理模型（LRMs）在安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，实验表明即使最先进的LRMs也存在显著安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LRMs在推理能力增强时暴露的安全隐患，特别是当推理与有害性交织时，模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出HauntAttack框架，通过将有害指令嵌入推理问题中，逐步引导模型生成不安全输出。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的LRMs也存在显著安全漏洞，并对不同模型、有害指令类型及输出模式进行了详细分析。

Conclusion: HauntAttack揭示了LRMs的安全脆弱性，为未来模型安全设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

*Yukai Zhou,Sibei Yang,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出LLMs在回答看似无害的输入时可能引发隐性危害，并通过JailFlipBench基准测试和攻击方法揭示了这一风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实应用中的安全性问题日益突出，尤其是隐性危害（Implicit Harm）未被充分研究。

Method: 提出JailFlipBench基准测试，涵盖单模态、多模态和事实扩展场景，并开发JailFlip攻击方法。

Result: 评估显示隐性危害对开源和黑盒LLMs构成现实风险。

Conclusion: 呼吁扩展LLM安全性评估，超越传统越狱范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EVSE系统面临严峻的网络安全挑战，传统入侵检测方法难以应对针对其漏洞的复杂攻击。

Result: 实验显示，该框架在分散环境中检测率超过98%，精确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为EVSE安全提供了可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案，有效应对高级网络威胁。

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

Result: 比较了不同AI技术的准确性、可解释性、计算开销和实时适用性，揭示了各自的优势和不足。

Conclusion: AI驱动的漏洞检测技术前景广阔，但仍需解决开放挑战，如进一步提升准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this
domain.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，通过视觉令牌剪枝和梯度更新剪枝机制，解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中差分隐私（DP）带来的计算开销和模型性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的应用效果不确定，且存在计算开销大和模型性能下降的问题，需要一种高效的方法来平衡隐私与性能。

Method: 提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，包含两种剪枝机制：视觉令牌剪枝减少输入维度，梯度更新剪枝基于噪声梯度幅度选择性剪枝参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能损失最小的情况下取得竞争性结果，计算效率优于标准DP-SGD，内存效率在H20 GPU上表现领先。

Conclusion: Dual-Priv Pruning是首个探索MLLMs中DP微调的方法，有效解决了隐私与性能的权衡问题。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了Web-use代理的高权限能力可能被恶意利用，通过任务对齐注入技术攻击代理，提出了多种有效载荷类型和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-use代理的高权限能力为攻击者提供了新的攻击面，研究旨在揭示其潜在风险并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过任务对齐注入技术，将恶意命令伪装成任务指导，评估了四种流行代理的九种攻击载荷。

Result: 攻击成功率达80%-100%，涵盖多种安全威胁，如未经授权的摄像头激活和密码泄露。

Conclusion: 提出了包括监督机制和执行约束在内的缓解策略，为安全开发和部署提供方向。

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦多智能体深度强化学习（FMADRL）的移动目标防御（MTD）框架，用于无人机群网络中的DoS攻击自适应缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机群网络的开放无线环境、动态拓扑和资源限制使其容易受到DoS攻击，传统静态或集中式防御机制不适用。

Method: 设计了三种轻量级协调的MTD机制（领导者切换、路由变异和频率跳变），并通过FMADRL算法实现分布式学习和策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，攻击缓解率提升34.6%，恢复时间减少94.6%，能耗和防御成本分别降低29.3%和98.3%。

Conclusion: FMADRL驱动的MTD框架能有效提升无人机群网络在DoS攻击下的弹性和任务连续性。

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流量隐私保护统计特征的绿色方法，用于识别物联网恶意软件网络攻击，并通过优化树模型超参数在性能和能耗间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备因资源限制和难以应用安全补丁而容易受到网络攻击，现有机器学习方法多关注攻击检测而忽视计算资源消耗。

Method: 优化决策树、随机森林和Extra-Trees的超参数，基于能耗和性能（马修斯相关系数）选择模型。

Result: 模型在保持高性能和检测准确率的同时显著降低了能耗（瓦时）。

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的本地入侵检测系统适合物联网等资源受限设备。

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

performance on standard speech. The proposed framework offers a scalable,
efficient solution for real-world disordered speech recognition.

answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需辅助信息的多说话人语音识别框架，通过Speaker-Distinguishable CTC（SD-CTC）改进SOT模型，显著降低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SOT模型因说话人分配失败导致的识别错误问题，避免依赖难以提取的辅助信息。

Method: 扩展CTC为SD-CTC，联合分配帧的标记和说话人标签，并将其集成到SOT框架中。

Result: 多任务学习SD-CTC和SOT将SOT模型的错误率降低26%，性能接近依赖辅助信息的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SD-CTC有效提升多说话人语音识别性能，无需依赖辅助信息。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

*Woongjib Choi,Byeong Hyeon Kim,Hyungseob Lim,Inseon Jang,Hong-Goo Kang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的参数化非盲带宽扩展方法，结合DNN技术以改进传统SBR的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SBR方法在处理多种音频信号时存在局限性，而现有的DNN盲方法性能不佳。

Method: 采用DNN在音频编码管道的首尾进行侧信息提取和带宽扩展。

Result: 新方法有望取代传统SBR，提升带宽扩展性能。

Conclusion: 结合DNN的参数化非盲方法为解决带宽扩展问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

Conclusion: AnnoDPO 为蛋白质功能预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deciphering protein function remains a fundamental challenge in protein
representation learning. The task presents significant difficulties for protein
language models (PLMs) due to the sheer volume of functional annotation
categories and the highly imbalanced distribution of annotated instances across
biological ontologies. Inspired by the remarkable success of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) in large language model (LLM) alignment, we
propose AnnoDPO, a novel multi-modal framework for protein function prediction
that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance annotation
learning. Our methodology addresses the dual challenges of annotation scarcity
and category imbalance through preference-aligned training objectives,
establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein
representation learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von
Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility theorem using the Lean 4 interactive
theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness,
transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of
both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization
captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by
expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence
axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries,
constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments
validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while
offering greater precision at decision boundaries.
  This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for applications in
economic modeling, AI alignment, and management decision systems, bridging the
gap between theoretical decision theory and computational implementation.

Conclusion: 论文为LLMs在硬件设计领域的应用提供了基准和分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

Conclusion: QForce-RL适用于资源受限设备，提供高效部署方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计规则检查（DRC）对降低集成电路设计成本和提高效率至关重要，机器学习方法成为重要研究方向。

Method: MAGNet结合改进的U-Net（含动态注意力模块和多尺度卷积模块）和图神经网络，通过像素对齐的图结构建模拓扑关系，并采用标签放大策略增强稀疏违规模式的敏感性。

Result: MAGNet在DRC热点检测中表现优于ibUnet、RouteNet和J-Net，显著提升了整体性能。

Conclusion: MAGNet通过结合空间、语义和结构信息，实现了更准确的DRC违规预测，并通过增量训练进一步优化热点识别能力。

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代芯片设计复杂，需要从Verilog代码早期预测设计质量指标（如时序和布线拥塞），尤其是行级预测。

Method: VeriLoC利用Verilog代码生成LLM提取行级和模块级嵌入，训练分类器/回归器。

Result: VeriLoC在行级拥塞和时序预测上F1分数达0.86-0.95，平均百分比误差降至4%。

Conclusion: VeriLoC的嵌入和方法对其他硬件设计预测和优化任务也有价值。

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

*Enqiang Zhu,Yu Zhang,Haopeng Sun,Ziqi Wei,Witold Pedrycz,Chanjuan Liu,Jin Xu*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HyColor的高效混合启发式算法，用于解决图着色问题（GCP），特别擅长处理大规模稀疏图和小规模密集图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCP算法主要针对小规模难解图或大规模稀疏图，缺乏一种能同时高效处理两者的方法。

Method: HyColor结合了局部决策策略、图简化策略以及基于k核和混合度的贪心启发式方法。

Result: 在209个实例的测试中，HyColor在93%的实例中表现最佳，显著优于现有算法，并在128个实例中实现了最优着色。

Conclusion: HyColor是一种高效且通用的GCP算法，适用于多种图类型。

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.
