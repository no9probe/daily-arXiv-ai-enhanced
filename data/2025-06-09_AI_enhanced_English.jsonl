The authors of these studies compared\ntheir schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the\ngoodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The\nmathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are\nanalyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are\nindependent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments\ncarried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis.

This analysis leads one to conclude that if a\nsub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal\nscheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn\nusing weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit\ninstead of Rosin's measure.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates whether weighted figure of merit can replace Rosin's measure for comparing polygonal approximation schemes, concluding they are independent and not interchangeable.", "motivation": "To determine if weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are related, allowing substitution in evaluating sub-optimal polygonal approximation schemes.", "method": "Theoretical analysis, experimental investigation, and statistical analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient) using public datasets.", "result": "The two measures are theoretically independent, experimentally uncorrelated, and cannot substitute each other.", "conclusion": "Weighted figure of merit cannot replace Rosin's measure for comparing sub-optimal schemes due to their independence."}}
